<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The thoughtful observer must have noted in the recent past many
indications of an awakened interest both in the concept of
education and in school procedure on the part of school officials,
teachers, and the public. Educators have been developing
pedagogical principles that strike their roots deep into the
philosophy of life, and now their pronouncements are invading the
consciousness of people of all ranks and causing them to realize
more and more that the school process is an integral part of the
life process and not something detached from life.</p>
<p>The following pages constitute an attempt to interpret some of
the school processes in terms of life processes, and to suggest
ways in which these processes may be made identical.</p>
<p>It is hoped that teachers who may read these pages may find
running through them a strand of optimism that will give them
increased faith in their own powers, a larger hope for the future
of the school, and an access of zeal to press valiantly forward in
their efforts to excel themselves.</p>

<h3>TEACHING SCHOOL</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life and living
compared.</span>&mdash;There is a wide difference between
school-teaching and teaching school. The question &ldquo;Is she a
school-teacher?&rdquo; means one thing; but the question &ldquo;Can
she teach school?&rdquo; means quite another. School-teaching may
be living; but teaching school is life. And any one who has a
definition of life can readily find a definition for teaching
school. Much of the criticism of the work of the schools emanates
from sources that have a restricted concept of life. The artisan
who defines life in terms of his own trade is impatient with much
that the school is trying to do. He would have the scope of the
school narrowed to his concept of life. If art and literature are
beyond the limits of his concept, he can see no warrant for their
presence in the school. The work of the schools cannot be
standardized until life itself is standardized, and that is neither
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name=
"page2"></a>2</span>possible nor desirable. The glory of life is
that it does not have fixity, that it is ever crescent.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Teaching defined.</span>&mdash;Teaching
school may be defined, therefore, as the process of interpreting
life by the laboratory method. The teacher&rsquo;s work is to open
the gates of life for the pupils. But, before these gates can be
opened, the teacher must know what and where they are. This view of
the teacher&rsquo;s work is neither fanciful nor fantastic; quite
the contrary. Life is the common heritage of people young and old,
and the school should be so organized and administered as to teach
people how to use this heritage to the best advantage both for
themselves and for others. If a child should be absent from school
altogether, or if he should be incarcerated in prison from his
sixth to his eighteenth year, he would still have life. But, if he
is in school during those twelve years, he is supposed to have life
that is of better quality and more abundant. Life is not measured
by years, but by its own intensity and scope. It has often been
said that some people have more life in threescore and ten years
than Methuselah had in his more than nine hundred years.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life measured by
intensity.</span>&mdash;This statement is not demonstrable, of
course, but it serves to make <span class="pagenum"><a id="page3"
name="page3"></a>3</span>evident the fact that some people have
more of life in a given time than others in the same time. In this
sense, life may be measured by the number of reactions to
objectives. These reactions may be increased by training. Two
persons, in passing a shop-window, may not see the same objects; or
one may see twice as many as the other, according to their ability
to react. The man who was locked in a vault at the cemetery by
accident, and was not discovered for an hour, thought he had spent
four days in his imprisonment. He had really lived four days in a
single hour by reason of the intensity of life during that
hour.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;In the case
of dreams, we are told that years may be condensed into minutes, or
even seconds, by reason of the rapidity of reactions. The rapidity
and intensity of these reactions make themselves manifest on the
face of the dreamer. Beads of perspiration and facial contortions
betoken intensity of feeling. In such an experience life is
intense. If a mental or spiritual cyclometer could be used in such
a case, it would make a high record of speed. Life sometimes
touches bottom, and sometimes scales the heights. But the distance
between these extremes varies greatly in different persons.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>4</span>The
life of one may have but a single octave; of the other, eight, or a
hundred, or a thousand. The life of Job is an apt illustration. No
one has been able to sound the depths of his suffering, nor has any
one been able to measure the heights of his exaltation. We may not
readily compute the octaves in such a life as his.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The complexity of life.</span>&mdash;It
is not easy to think life, much less define it. The elements are so
numerous as to baffle and bewilder the mind. It looks out at one
from so many corners that it seems Argus-eyed. At one moment we see
it on the Stock Exchange where men struggle and strive in a mad
frenzy of competition; at another, in a quiet home, where a mother
soothes her baby to sleep, where there is no competition but,
rather, a sublime monopoly. Again, it manifests itself in the
clanking of machinery where men are tunneling the mountain or
constructing a canal to unite oceans; or, again, in the laboratory
where the microscope is revealing the form of the snow crystal. One
man is watching the movements of the heavenly bodies as they file
by his telescope, while another writes a proclamation that makes
free a race of people. Another man is leading an army into battle,
while <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name=
"page5"></a>5</span>some Doctor MacClure is breasting the storm in
the darkness as he goes forth on his mission of mercy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Manifestations of
life.</span>&mdash;These manifestations of life men call trade,
commerce, history, mathematics, science, nature, and philanthropy.
And men write these words in books, and other men write other books
trying to explain their meaning. Then, still others divide and
subdivide, and science becomes the sciences, and mathematics
becomes arithmetic, and algebra, and geometry, and trigonometry,
and calculus, and astronomy. Here mathematics and science seem to
merge. And, in time, history and geography come together, and
sometimes strive for precedence.</p>
<p>Thus, books accumulate into libraries and so add another to the
many elements of life. Then magazines are written to explain the
books and their authors. The motive behind the book is analyzed in
an effort to discover the workings of the author&rsquo;s mind and
heart. In these revelations we sometimes hear the rippling of the
brook, and sometimes the moan of the sea; sometimes the cooing of
the dove, and sometimes the scream of the eagle; sometimes the
bleating of the lamb, and sometimes the roaring of the lion. In
them we see the moonbeams that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"
name="page6"></a>6</span>play among the flowers and the lightning
that rends the forest; the blossoms that filter from the trees and
the avalanche that carries destruction; the rain that fructifies
the earth and the hurricane that destroys.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life in literature.</span>&mdash;Back of
these sights and sounds we discover men&mdash;Cicero, Demosthenes,
Homer, Isaiah, Shakespeare, Milton, Dante. We trace the thoughts
and emotions of these men and find literature. And in literature,
again, we come upon another manifestation of life. Literature is
what it is because these men were what they were. They saw and felt
life to be large and so wrote it down large; and because they wrote
it thus, what they wrote endures. They stood upon the heights and
saw the struggles of man with himself, with other men, and with
nature. This panorama generated thoughts and feelings in them, and
these they could not but portray. And so literature and life are
identical and not co&ouml;rdinates, as some would have us
think.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life as subject matter in
teaching.</span>&mdash;In teaching school, therefore, the subject
matter with which we have to do is life&mdash;nothing more and
nothing less. We may call it history, or mathematics, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name=
"page7"></a>7</span>literature, or psychology,&mdash;but it still
remains true that life is the real objective of all our activities.
And, as has been already said, we are teaching life by the
laboratory method. We are striving to interpret the thing in which
we are immersed. We feel, and think, and aspire, and love, and
enjoy. All these are life; and from this life we are striving to
extract strength that our feeling may be deeper, our thinking
higher, our aspirations wider and more lofty, our love purer and
nobler, and our own enjoyment greater. By absorbing the life that
is all about us we strive to have more abundant and abounding
life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s
province.</span>&mdash;Such is the province of one who essays the
task of teaching school. School is life, as we have been told; but,
at the same time, it is a place and an occasion for teaching life.
If we could detach history from life, it would cease to be history.
If literature is not life, it is not literature; and so with the
sciences. These branches are but variants or branches of life, and
all emanate from a common center. Whether we scan the heavens,
penetrate the depths of the sea, pore over the pages of books, or
look into the minds and hearts of men, we are striving after an
interpretation of life.</p>

<h3>THE TEACHER</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Teachers contrasted.</span>&mdash;The
vitalized school is an expression of the vitalized teacher. In the
hands of the teacher of another sort, the vitalized school is
impossible. Unless she can see in the multiplication table the
power that throws the bridge across the river, that builds
pyramids, that constructs railways, that sends ships across the
ocean, that tunnels mountains and navigates the air, this table
becomes a stupid thing, a dead thing, and an incubus upon the
spirits of her pupils. To such a teacher mathematics is a lifeless
thing, without hope or potency, the school is a mere convenience
for the earning of a livelihood, the work is the drudgery of
bondage, and the children are little less than an impertinence. The
vitalized teacher is different. To her the multiplication table
pulsates with life. It stretches forth its beneficent hand to give
employment to a million workers, and food to a million homes. It
pervades every mart of trade; it loads <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page10" name="page10"></a>10</span>trains and ships with the
commerce of nations; and it helps to amplify and ennoble
civilization.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Vitalized mathematics.</span>&mdash;In
this table she sees a prophecy of great achievements in
engineering, architecture, transportation, and the myriad
applications of science. In brief, mathematics to her is vibrant
with life both in its present uses and in its possibilities. She
knows that it is a part of the texture of the daily life of every
home as well as of national life. She knows that it pertains to
individual, community, and national well-being. Knowing this, she
feels that it is quite worth while for herself and her pupils, both
for the present and for the future. She feels that, if she would
know life, she must know mathematics, because it is a part of life;
that, if she would teach life to her pupils, she must teach them
mathematics as an integral part of life; and that she must teach it
in such a way that it will be as much a part of themselves as their
bodily organs. She wants them to know the mathematics as they know
that the rain is falling or that the sun is shining, because the
rain, the sunshine, and the mathematics are all elements of life.
Her great aim is to have her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"
name="page11"></a>11</span>pupils experience the study just as they
experience other phases of life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s
attitude.</span>&mdash;Such a teacher with such a conception of
life and of her work finds teaching school the very reverse of
drudgery. Each day is an exhilarating experience of life. Her
pupils are a part of life to her. She enjoys life and, hence,
enjoys them. They are her confederates in the fine game of life.
The bigness and exuberance of her abundant life enfolds them all,
and from the very atmosphere of her presence they absorb life.
Their studies, under the influence of her magic, are as much a part
of life to them as the air they breathe or the food they eat. No
two days are alike in her school, for life to-day is larger than it
was yesterday and so presents a new aspect. Her spirit carries over
into their spirits the truths of the books, and these truths thus
become inherent.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">College influences.</span>&mdash;She
teaches life, albeit through the medium of subjects and books,
because she knows life. Her college work did not consist in the
gathering together of many facts, but in accumulating experiences
of life. Many of these experiences were acquired vicariously, but
they were no less real on that account. Her generous <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>12</span>nature was able
to withstand the most assiduous efforts of some of her teachers to
quench the flames of life that glowed in the pages of books, with
the wet blanket of erudition. She was able to relive the thoughts
and feelings of the authors whose books she studied and so make
their experiences her own. She could reconstitute the emotional
life of her authors and gain potency through the transfusion of
spirit. Her books were living things, and she gleaned life from
their pages.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Reading and life.</span>&mdash;She can
teach reading because she can read. Reading to her is an experience
in life. The words on the printed page are not meaningless
hieroglyphics. They are the electric wires which connect the soul
of the author with her own, and through which the current is
continually passing. When she reads Dickens, Tiny Tim is never a
mere boy with a crutch, but he is Tiny Tim, and, as such, neither
men nor angels can supplant him on the printed page. She knows the
touch of him and the voice of him. She laughs with him; she cries
with him; she prays with him; she lives with him. In her teaching
she causes Tiny Tim to stand forth like a cameo to her pupils, with
no rival and no peer. This she can do <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page13" name="page13"></a>13</span>because he is a part of her
life. She has no occasion either to pose or to rhapsodize.
Sincerity is its own explanation and justification.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Power of understanding.</span>&mdash;When
she reads &ldquo;Little Boy Blue&rdquo; she can hear the sobbing of
a heartbroken mother and thus, vicariously, comes to know the
universality of death and sorrow. But she finds faith and hope in
the poem, also, and so can see the sunlight suffusing the clouds of
the mother&rsquo;s grief. Thus she enters into the feeling of
motherhood and so shares the life of all the mothers whose children
are her pupils. In every page she reads she crosses anew the
threshold of life and gains a knowledge of its joys, its sorrows,
its triumphs, or its defeats. In short, she reads with the spirit
and not merely with the mind, and thus catches the spiritual
meaning of what she reads. She can feel as well as think and so can
emotionalize the printed page. Nature has endowed her with a
sensory foundation that reacts to the emotional situations that the
author produces. Thus she understands, and that is the prime
desideratum in reading. And because she understands, she can
interpret, and cause her pupils to understand. Thus they receive
another endowment of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name=
"page14"></a>14</span><span class="paraHead">Books as exponents of
life.</span>&mdash;She has time for reading as she has time for
eating and drinking, and for the same reason. To her they are all
co&ouml;rdinate elements of life. She eats, and sleeps, and reads
because she is alive; and she is more alive because she eats, and
sleeps, and reads. She taps the sources of spiritual refreshment,
without parade, and rejoices in the consequent enrichment of her
life. She does not smite the rock, but speaks to it, and smiles
upon it, and the waters gush forth. She descends into Hades with
Dante, and ascends Sinai with Moses, and is refreshed and
strengthened by her journeys. She sits enrapt as Shakespeare turns
the kaleidoscope of life for her, or stands enthralled by Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s picture of the human soul. Her sentient spirit is
ignited by the fires of genius that glow between the covers of the
book, and her fine enthusiasm carries the divine conflagration over
into the spirits of her pupils. There is, therefore, no drag or
listlessness in her class in reading, because, during this
exercise, life is as buoyant and spontaneous as it is upon the
playground.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The meaning of history.</span>&mdash;In
her teaching of history she invests all the characters with life,
because to her they are alive. And because they are <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>alive to her
they are alive to her pupils. They are instinct with power, action,
life. She rehabilitates the scenes in which they moved, and,
therefore, they must be alive in order to perform their parts. They
are all flesh and blood people with all the attributes of people.
They are all actuated by motives and move along their appointed
ways obedient to the laws of cause and effect. They are not named
in the book to be learned and recited, but to be known. She causes
her pupils to know them as they would come to know people in her
home. Nor do they ever mistake one for the other or confuse their
actions. They know them too well for that. These characters are
made to stand wide apart, so that, being thus seen, they will ever
after be known. History is not a directory of names, but groups of
people going about their tasks. They hunger, and thirst, and love,
and hate, and struggle with their environment as their descendants
are doing to-day.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Language and vitality.</span>&mdash;When
she is teaching a language, it is never less than a living
language. In Latin the syntax is learned as a means, never an end.
The big things in the study loom too large for that. The pupils
become so eager to see what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"
name="page16"></a>16</span>C&aelig;sar will do next that they
cannot afford the time to stare long at a mere ablative absolute.
They are following the parade, and are not to be turned aside from
their large purpose by minor matters. They are made to see and hear
Cicero; and Rome becomes a reality, with its Forum, its Senate, and
its Mamertine. When Dido sears the soul of the faithless
&AElig;neas with her words of scorn, the girls applaud and the boys
tremble. When Troy burns, there is a real fire, and Achates is as
real as the man Friday. When the shipwrecked Trojans regale
themselves with venison, it is no make-believe dinner, but a real
one. Where such a teacher is, there can be no dead language, no dry
bones of history, and no stagnation in the stream of life.</p>

<h3>THE CHILD</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child as the center in school
procedure.</span>&mdash;The child is the center of school procedure
in all its many ramifications. For the child the building is
erected, the equipment is provided, the course of study is arranged
and administered, and the teacher employed. The child is major, and
all else is subsidiary. In the general scheme even the teacher
takes secondary place. Teachers may come and go, but the child
remains as the focus of all plans and purposes. The teacher is
secured for the child, and not the child for the teacher.
Taxpayers, boards of education, parents, and teachers are all
active in the interests of the child; and all school legislation,
to be important, must have the child as its prime objective.
Colleges of education and normal schools, in large numbers, are
working at the educational problem in an effort to develop more
effective methods of training the teachers of the child. A host of
authors and publishers are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"
name="page19"></a>19</span>giving to the interest of the child the
products of their skill. In every commonwealth may be found a large
number of men and women whose time and energies are devoted to the
work of the schools for the child.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">All children should have school
privileges.</span>&mdash;All these facts are freely admitted,
wherever attention is called to them, but we still have truant
officers, and child labor laws. We admit the facts, but, in our
practices, strive to circumvent their application. If the school is
good for one child, it is good for all children. Indeed, the school
is maintained on the assumption that all children will take
advantage of and profit by its presence. If there were no schools,
our civilization would surely decline. If school attendance should
cease at the end of the fifth year, then we would have a fifth-year
civilization. It rests, therefore, with the parents of the
children, in large measure, whether we are to have an eighth-grade
civilization, a high-school civilization, or a college
civilization.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Parental attitude.</span>&mdash;Schools
are administered on the assumption that every child is capable of
and worthy of training, and that training the child will make for a
better quality of civilization. The state <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>20</span>regards the
child as a liability during his childhood in the hope that he may
be an asset in his manhood. In this hope time and money are devoted
to his training. But, in the face of all this, there are parents,
here and there, who still look upon their own children as assets
and would use them for their own comfort or profit. They seem to
think that their children are indebted to them for bringing them
into the world and that their obligation to the children is
canceled by meager provision of food, shelter, and clothing. They
seem not to realize that &ldquo;life is more than fruit or
grain,&rdquo; and deny to their children the elements of life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The rights of the child.</span>&mdash;All
this is a sort of preface to the statement that the child comes
into the world endowed with certain inherent rights that may not be
abrogated. He has a right to life in its best and fullest sense,
and no one has a right to abridge this measure of life, or to
deprive him of anything that will contribute to such a life. He
goes to the school as one of the sources of life, and any one who
denies him this boon is doing violence to his right to have life.
He does not go to school to study arithmetic, but studies
arithmetic as one of the elements of life; and experience has
demonstrated <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name=
"page21"></a>21</span>that arithmetic may be learned in the school
more advantageously than elsewhere. He goes to school to have
agreeable and profitable life. Each day is an integer of life and
must be made to abound in life if it is to be accounted a
success.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Child life.</span>&mdash;Again, the child
has a right to the quality of life that is consistent with and
congenial to his age. A seven-year-old should be a seven-year-old,
in his thinking, in his activities, in his amusements, and in his
feeling. We should never ask or want him to &ldquo;put away
childish things&rdquo; at this age, for these childish things are a
proof of his normality and good health. His buoyant life and good
health may prove disastrous to the furniture in his home, but far
better marred furniture than marred childhood. If, at this age, he
should become as quiet and sedate as his father, his parents and
teacher would have cause for alarm. It is the high privilege of the
parent and the teacher to direct his activities, but not to abridge
or interdict them. If the teacher would reduce him to inaction and
silence, she may well reflect that if he were an imbecile he would
be quiet. He will not pass this way again; and if he is ever to
have the sort of life that is in harmony with his age, he must have
it now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name=
"page22"></a>22</span><span class="paraHead">Childhood
curtailed.</span>&mdash;He has a right, also, to the full measure
of childhood. This period is relatively short, and any curtailment
does violence to his physiological and psychological nature. All
the years of his childhood are necessary for a proper balancing of
his physical and mental powers, that they may do their appointed
work in after years. Entire volumes have been devoted to this
subject, but, in spite of these volumes, some mothers still try to
hurry their daughters into the duties and responsibilities of adult
life. One such mother went to the high school to get the books of
her fifteen-year-old daughter and, upon being asked why the
daughter was leaving school, replied, &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s
keeping company now.&rdquo; That daughter will never be the hardy
plant in civilization that she ought to be, because she was reared
in a hothouse atmosphere. That mother had no right to cripple the
life of her child by thwarting nature&rsquo;s decrees.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Detrimental effects.</span>&mdash;The
pity of it all is that the child is at the mercy of the parent, or
of the teacher, as the case may be. We become so eager to have
&ldquo;old heads on young shoulders&rdquo; that we begrudge the
child the years that are necessary for the shoulders to attain that
maturity of strength <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name=
"page23"></a>23</span>that is needful for supporting the &ldquo;old
heads.&rdquo; Then ensues a lack of balance, and, were all children
thus denied their right to the full period of youth, we should have
a distorted civilization. Dickens inveighs against this curtailment
of youth prodigiously, and the marvel is that we have failed to
learn the lesson from his pages. We need not have recourse to
Victor Hugo to know the life of little Cosette, for we can see her
prototype by merely looking about us.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s right to the
best.</span>&mdash;As the child has a right to life in its
fullness, so he has a right to all the agencies that can promote
this type of life. If he meets with an accident he has a right to
the best surgical skill that can be secured, and this right we
readily concede; and equally he has a right to the best teacher
that money will secure. If he has a teacher that is less than the
best, the time thus lost can never be restored to him. A lady who
had an unskillful teacher in her first year in the high school now
avers that he maimed her for life in that particular study. Life is
such a delicate affair that it demands expert handling. If we hope
to have the child attain his right to be an intelligent
co&ouml;perating agent in promoting life in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>society, then
no price is too great to pay for the expert teaching which will
nurture the sort of life in him that will make him effective.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s native
tendencies.</span>&mdash;Then, again, the child has a right to the
exercise of the native tendencies with which he is endowed. In
fact, these tendencies should be the working capital of the
teacher, the starting points in her teaching. There was a time when
the teacher punished the child who was caught drawing pictures on
his slate. Happily that sort of barbarity disappeared, in the main,
along with the slate. The vitalized teacher rejoices in the
pictures that the child draws and turns this tendency to good
account. Through this inclination to draw she finds the real child
and so, as the psychologists direct, she begins where the child is
and sets about attaching to this native tendency the work in nature
study, geography, or history. When she discovers a constructive
tendency in the child, she at once uses this in shifting from
analytic to synthetic exercises in the school order. If he enjoys
making things, he will be glad of an opportunity to make devices,
or problems, or maps.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The play instinct.</span>&mdash;She makes
large use, also, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name=
"page25"></a>25</span>of the play instinct that is one of his
native tendencies. This instinct is constantly reaching out for
objects of play. The teacher is quick to note the child&rsquo;s
quest for objects and deftly substitutes some phase of school work
for marbles, balls, or dolls, and his playing proceeds apace
without abatement of zest. The vitalized teacher knows how to
attach the arithmetic to this play instinct and make it a
fascinating game. During the games of arithmetic, geography,
history, or spelling, life is at high tide in her school and the
work is thorough in consequence. Work is relieved of the onus of
drudgery whenever it appears in the guise of a game, and the
teacher who has skill in attaching school studies to the play
instinct of the child will make her school effective as well as a
delight to herself and her pupils. In such a plan there is neither
place nor occasion for coercion.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Self-expression.</span>&mdash;Another
right of the child is the right to express himself. The desire for
self-expression is fundamental in the human mind, as the study of
arch&aelig;ology abundantly proves. Since this is true, every
school should be a school of expression if the nature of the child
is to have full recognition. Without expression there is no
impression, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name=
"page26"></a>26</span>and without impression there is no education
that has real value. The more and better expression in the school,
therefore, the more and better the education in that school. In the
vitalized school we shall find freedom of expression, and the
absence of unreasoning repression. The child expresses himself by
means of his hands, his feet, his face, his entire body, and his
organs of speech, and his expression through either of these means
gives the teacher a knowledge of what to do. These expressions may
not be what the teacher would wish, but the expression necessarily
precedes intelligent teaching.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Imagination.</span>&mdash;These
expressions may reveal a vivid imagination, but they are no less
valuable as indices of the child&rsquo;s nature on that account. It
is the very refinement of cruelty to try to interdict or stifle the
child&rsquo;s imagination. But for the imagination of people in the
past we should not have the rich treasures of mythology that so
delight us all. Every child with imagination is constructing a
mythology of his own, and from the gossamer threads of fancy is
weaving a pattern of life that no parent or teacher should ever
wish to forbid or destroy. Day by day, he sees visions and dreams
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name=
"page27"></a>27</span>dreams, and so builds for himself a world in
which he finds delight and profit. In this world he is king, and
only profane hands would dare attempt to dethrone him.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s
experiences.</span>&mdash;His experiences, whether in the real
world, or in this world of fancy, are his capital in the bank of
life; and he has every right to invest this capital so as to
achieve further increments of life. In this enterprise, the teacher
is his counselor and guide, and, in order that she may exercise
this function sympathetically and rationally, she must know the
nature and extent of his capital. If he knows a bird, he may invest
this knowledge so as to gain a knowledge of many birds, and so, in
time, compass the entire realm of ornithology. If he knows a
flower, from this known he may be so directed that he may become a
master in the unknown field of botany. If he knows coal, this
experience may be made the open sesame to the realms of geology. In
short, all his experiences may be capitalized under the direction
of a skillful teacher, and made to produce large dividends as an
investment in life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Relation to school
work.</span>&mdash;Thus the school becomes, for the child, a place
of and for real life, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"
name="page28"></a>28</span>not a place detached from life. There he
lives effectively, and joyously, because the teacher knows how to
utilize his experiences and native dispositions for the enlargement
of his life. He has no inclination to become a deserter or a
tenant, for life is agreeable there, and the school is made his
chief interest. His work is not doled out to him in the form of
tasks, but is graciously presented as a privilege, and as such he
esteems it. There he learns to live among people of differing
tastes and interests without abdicating his own individuality.
There he learns that life is work and that work is the very
quintessence of life.</p>

<h3>THE CHILD OF THE FUTURE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Rights of the coming
generations.</span>&mdash;Any school procedure that limits its
interests and activities to the present generation takes a too
restricted view of the real scope of education. The children of the
next generation, and the next, are entitled to consideration if
education is to do its perfect work and have complete and
convincing justification. The child of the future has a right to
grandfathers and grandmothers of sound body and sound mind, and the
schools and homes of the present are charged with the
responsibility of seeing to it that this right is vouchsafed to
him. In actual practice our plans seem not to previse grandfathers
and grandmothers, and stop short even of fathers and mothers. The
child of the next generation has a right to a father and a mother
of untainted blood, and neither the home nor the school can ignore
this right.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Transmitted weaknesses.</span>&mdash;If
these rights are not scrupulously respected by the present
generation, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name=
"page31"></a>31</span>the child of the future may come into the
world under a handicap that all the educational agencies combined
can neither remove nor materially mitigate. If he is crippled in
mind or in body because of excesses on the part of his progenitors,
the schools and hospitals may help him through life in a sorry sort
of fashion, but his condition is evermore a reminder to him of how
much he has missed in comparison with the child of sound body and
mind. If such a child does not imprecate even the memory of the
ancestors whose vitiated blood courses through his stricken body,
it will be because his mind is too weak to reason from effect to
cause or because his affliction has taught him large charity. He
will feel that he has been shamefully cheated in the great game of
life, with no hope of restitution. By reason of this, his gaze is
turned backward instead of forward, and this is a reversal of the
rightful attitude of child life. Instead of looking forward with
hope and happiness, he droops through a somber life and constantly
broods upon what might have been.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Attitude of
ancestors.</span>&mdash;Whether he realizes it or not, he reduces
the average of humanity and is a burden upon society both in a
negative and in a positive sense. In him society loses a worker and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name=
"page32"></a>32</span>gains a dependent. Every taxpayer of the
community must contribute to the support which he is unable to
provide for himself. He watches other children romp and play and
laugh; but he neither romps, nor plays, nor laughs. He is inert.
Some ancestor chained him to the rock, and the vultures of disease
and unhappiness are feeding at his vitals. He asks for bread, and
they give him a stone; he asks for life, and they give him a living
death; he asks for a heaven of delight, and they give him a hell of
despair. He has a right to freedom, but, in place of that, he is
forced into slavery of body and soul to pay the debts of his
grandfather. Nor can he pay these debts in full, but must,
perforce, pass them on to his own children. Sad to relate, the
father and grandfather look upon such a child and charge Providence
with unjust dealing in burdening them with such an imperfect scion
to uphold the family name. They seem blind to the patent truth
before them; they seem unable to interpret the law of cause and
effect; they charge the Almighty and the child with their own
defections; they acquit themselves of any responsibility for what
is before their eyes.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Hospitals cited.</span>&mdash;Our
hospitals for abnormal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name=
"page33"></a>33</span>and subnormal children, and our eleemosynary
institutions, in general, are a sad commentary upon our
civilization and something of a reflection upon the school as an
exponent of and a teacher of life. If the wards of these
institutions, barring the victims of accidents, are the best we can
do in the way of coming upon a solution of the problem of life,
neither society nor the school has any special warrant for
exultation. These defectives did not just happen. The law of life
is neither fortuitous nor capricious. On the contrary, like begets
like, and the law is immutable. With lavish hand, society provides
the pound of cure but gives only superficial consideration to the
ounce of prevention. The title of education will be cloudy until
such time as these institutions have become a thing of the past.
Both pulpit and press extol the efforts of society to build, equip,
and maintain these institutions, and that is well; but, with all
that, we are merely trying to make the best of a bad situation.
Education will not fully come into its own until it takes into the
scope of its interests the child of the future as well as the child
of the present; not until it comes to regard the children of the
present as future ancestors as well as future citizens.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name=
"page34"></a>34</span><span class="paraHead">The child as a future
ancestor.</span>&mdash;If the children of the future are to prove a
blessing to society and not a burden, then the children of the
present need to become fully conscious of their responsibilities as
agencies in bringing to pass this desirable condition. If the
teacher or parent can, somehow, cause the boy of to-day to
visualize his own grandson, in the years to come, pointing the
finger of scorn at him and calling down maledictions upon him
because of a taint in the family blood, that picture will persist
in his consciousness, and will prove a deterrent factor in his
life. The desire for immortality is innate in every human breast,
we are taught, but certainly no boy will wish to achieve that sort
of immortality. He will not consider with complacency the
possibility of his becoming a pariah in the estimation of his
descendants, and will go far in an effort to avert such a
misfortune. There is no man but will shudder when he contemplates
the possibility of having perpetuated upon his gravestone or in the
memory of his grandchild the word &ldquo;Unclean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The heart of the
problem.</span>&mdash;Here we arrive at the very heart of the
problem that confronts the home and the school. We may close our
eyes, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name=
"page35"></a>35</span>look another way, but the problem remains. We
may not be able to solve it, but we cannot evade it. Each day it
calls loudly to every parent and every teacher for a solution. The
health and happiness of the coming generations depend upon the
right education of the present one, and this responsibility the
home and the school can neither shirk nor shift. We take great
unction to ourselves for the excellence of the horses, pigs, and
cattle that we have on exhibition at the fairs, but are silent as
to our failures in the form of children, that drag out a half-life
in our hospitals. In one state it costs more to care for the
defectives and unfortunates than to provide schooling facilities
for all the normal children, but this fact is not written into
party platforms nor proclaimed from the stump. In the face of such
a fact society seems to proceed upon the agreeable assumption that
the less said the better.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Misconceptions.</span>&mdash;We temporize
with the fundamental situation by the use of such soporifics as the
expressions &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; and the like, but that
leaves us exactly at the starting point. Many well-meaning people
use these expressions with great frequency and freedom and seem to
think that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name=
"page36"></a>36</span>in so doing they have given a proof of virtue
and public spirit. It were worthy only of an iconoclast to
deprecate or disparage the legislative attempts to foster clean
living. All such efforts are worthy of commendation; but in sadness
it must be confessed that, laudable as these efforts are, they have
not produced results that are wholly satisfactory. Defectives are
still granted licenses to perpetuate their kind; children still
enervate their bodies and minds by the use of narcotics; and
society daintily lifts its skirts as it hurries past the evil,
pretending not to see. Legislation is an attempt to express public
sentiment in statutory form; but public sentiment must precede
legislation if it is to become effective. Efforts have been made
through the process of legislation to deny the granting of marriage
licenses to people who are physically unsound, but the efforts came
to naught because public sentiment has not attained to this plane
of thinking. Hence, we shall not have much help from legislation in
solving our problem, until public sentiment has been educated.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The responsibility of the
school.</span>&mdash;This education must come, in large part,
through the schools, but even these will fail until they come into
a full <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name=
"page37"></a>37</span>realization of the fact that their field of
effort is life in the large. Time was when the teacher thought she
was employed to teach geography, grammar, and arithmetic. Then she
enlarged this to include boys and girls. And now she needs to make
another addition and realize that her function is to teach boys and
girls the subject of Life, using the branches of study as a means
to this end. In a report on the work of the schools at Gary,
Indiana, the statement is made that the first purpose of these
schools seems to be to produce efficient workers for the mills.
This seems to savor of the doctrine of educational foreordination,
and would make millwork and life synonymous. Life is larger than
any mill. We may be justified in educating one horse for the plow
and another for the race track, but this justification rests upon
the fact that horses are assets and not liabilities.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Clean living.</span>&mdash;Clean living
in this generation will, undeniably, project itself into the next,
and we have only to see to it that all the activities of the school
function in clean living in the child of to-day, and we shall
surely be safeguarding the interests of the child of the future.
But clean living means more than mere externals. The daily bath,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name=
"page38"></a>38</span>pure food, fresh air, and sanitary conditions
are essential but not sufficient in themselves. Clean thinking,
right motives, and a high respect for the rights and interests of
the future must enter into the scheme of life. There must be no
devious ways, no back alleys, in the scheme, but only the broad
highway of life, open always to the sunlight and to the gaze of all
mankind. All this must become thoroughly enmeshed in the social
consciousness and in the daily practice of every individual, before
the school can lay claim to success in the art of teaching
efficient living.</p>

<h3>THE TEACHER-POLITICIAN</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The politician defined.</span>&mdash;The
politician has been defined as one who makes a careful study of the
wants of his community and is diligent in his efforts to supply
these wants. This definition has, at the very least, the merit of
mitigating, if not removing, the stigma that attaches to
politicians in the popular thought. Conceding the correctness of
this definition, it must be evident that society is the beneficiary
of the work of the politician, and would be the gainer if the
number of politicians were multiplied. The motive of self-interest
lies back of all human activities, and education is constantly
striving to stimulate and accentuate this motive. Even in altruism
we may find an admixture of self-interest. The merchant who
arranges his goods artistically may hope by this means to win more
patronage, but, aside from this, he wins a feeling of
gratification. His self-interest may look either toward a greater
volume of business or to a better class of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>41</span>patrons, or
both. While he is enlarging the scope of his business, he may be
elevating the taste of his customers. In either case his
self-interest is commendable. A successful merchant is better for
the community than an unsuccessful one.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Self-interest.</span>&mdash;The physician
is actuated by the motive of self-interest, also. His years of
training are but a preparation for the competition that is certain
to fall to his lot. He is gratified at the increase of his
popularity as a successful practitioner. But he prescribes modes of
living as well as remedies, and so tries to forestall and prevent
disease, while he is exercising his curative skill. He tries not
only to restore health, but also to promote good health in the
community by his recommendations of pure food, pure water, fresh
air, and exercise. His motives are altruistic even while he is
consulting self-interest. None but the censorious will criticize
the minister for accepting a larger parish even with a larger
salary attached. The larger parish will afford him a wider field
for usefulness, and the larger salary will enable him to execute
more of his laudable plans.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The methods of the
politician.</span>&mdash;Hence it will be seen that, in the right
sense, merchants, physicians, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"
name="page42"></a>42</span>and ministers are all politicians in
that they seek to expand the sphere of their activities. Like the
politician they study the wants of the people in order to win a
starting point for leadership. True, there are quacks, charlatans,
hypocrites, and demagogues, but none of these, nor all combined,
avail to disprove the validity of the principle. It has often been
said that the churches would do well to study and use the art of
advertising that is so well understood by the saloons. This is
another way of saying that the methods of the politician will avail
in promoting right activities as well as wrong ones. The
politician, whether he is a business man or a professional man,
proceeds from the known to the related unknown, and thus shows
himself a conscious or unconscious student of psychology. He
studies that which is in order to promote that which should be.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Leadership.</span>&mdash;The politician
aspires to leadership, and that is praiseworthy, provided his cause
is a worthy one. If the cause is unworthy, the cloven foot will
soon appear and repudiation will ensue, which will mark him
unsuccessful as a politician. He may be actuated by the motive of
self-interest, in common with all others, but this interest may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name=
"page43"></a>43</span>focus in the amelioration of conditions as
they are or in the advancement of his friends. The satisfaction of
leadership is the sole reward of many a politician, with the added
pleasure of seeing his friends profit by this leadership. A
statesman is a politician grown large&mdash;large in respect to
motives, to plans and purposes, and to methods. The fundamental
principle, however, remains constant.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The politician worthy of
imitation.</span>&mdash;The successful politician must know people
and their wants. He must know conditions in order to direct the
course of his activities. Otherwise, he will find himself moving at
random, and this may prove disastrous to his purposes. Much
misdirected effort has been expended in disparaging the politician
and his methods. If the man and his methods were better understood,
they would often be found worthy of close imitation in the home, in
the school, in the church, in the professions, and in business.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Education and
substitution.</span>&mdash;Education, in the large, is the process
of making substitutions. Evermore, in school work, we are striving
to substitute something better for something not so good. In brief,
we are striving to substitute needs for wants. But before we can do
this we must determine, by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44"
name="page44"></a>44</span>careful study and close observation,
what the wants are. Ability to substitute needs for wants betokens
a high type of leadership. The boy wants to read Henty, but needs
to read Dickens or Shakespeare. How shall the teacher proceed in
order to make the substitution? Certainly it cannot be done by any
mere fiat or ukase. Those who are incredulous as to the wisdom of
establishing colleges of education and normal schools to generate
and promote methods of teaching have here a concrete and pertinent
question: Can a college of education or normal school give to an
embryo teacher any method by which she may effectively substitute
Shakespeare for Henty?</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Methods contrasted.</span>&mdash;Some
teachers have attempted to make this substitution by means of
ridicule and sarcasm and then called the boy stupid because he
continued to read his Henty. Others have indulged in rhapsodies on
Shakespeare, hoping to inoculate the boy with the Shakespearean
virus, and then called the boy stolid because he failed to share
their apparent rapture. The politician would have pursued neither
of these plans. His inherent or acquired psychology would have
admonished him to begin where the boy is. He <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>45</span>would have gone
to Henty to find the boy. Having found him, he would have sat down
beside him and entered into his interest in the book. In time he
would have found something in the book to remind him of a passage
in Shakespeare. This passage he would have read in his best style
and then resumed the reading of Henty. Thus, by degrees, he would
have effected the substitution, permitting the boy to think that
this had been done on his own initiative.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The principle
illustrated.</span>&mdash;The vitalized teacher observes, profits
by, and initiates into her work the method of the politician and so
makes her school work vital. Beginning with what the boy wants, she
lures him along, by easy stages, until she has brought him within
the circle of her own wants, which are, in reality, the needs of
the boy. The boy walks along in paces, let us say, of eighteen
inches. The teacher moderates her gait to harmonize with his, but
gradually lengthens her paces to two feet. At first, she kept step
with him; now he is keeping step with her and finds the enterprise
an exhilarating adventure. She is teaching the boy to walk in
strides two feet in length, and begins with his native tendency to
step eighteen inches. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name=
"page46"></a>46</span>Thus she begins where the boy is, by
acquainting herself with his wants, attaches her teaching to his
native tendencies, and then proceeds from the known to the related
unknown. Libraries abound in books that explain lucidly this simple
elementary principle of teaching, but many teachers still seem to
find it difficult of application.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Substitution
illustrated.</span>&mdash;This method of substitution becomes the
rule of the school through the skill of the vitalized teacher. The
lily of the valley is substituted for the sunflower, in the
children&rsquo;s esteem, and there is generated a taste for the
exquisite. The copy of the masterpiece of art supplants the bizarre
chromo; correct forms of speech take the place of incorrect forms;
the elegant usurps the place of the inelegant; and the inartistic
gives place to the artistic. The circle of their wants is extended
until it includes their needs, and these, in turn, are transformed
into wants. Thus all the pupils ascend to a higher level of
appreciation of the things that make for a more comfortable and
agreeable civilization. They work under the spell of leadership,
for real leadership always inspires confidence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Society and the school.</span>&mdash;At
its best, society is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name=
"page47"></a>47</span>but an enlarged copy of the vitalized school.
Or, to put it in another way, the vitalized school is society in
miniature. As the school is engaged in the work of making
substitutions, so, in fact, is society. Legislative bodies are
striving to substitute wise laws for the laws that have fallen
behind the needs of the times, that the interests of society may be
fully conserved. The church is substituting better methods of work
in all its activities for the methods that have become antiquated
or ineffective. This it does in the hope that its influence may be
broadened and deepened. Ministers and officials are constantly
pondering the question of substitutions. The farmer is substituting
better methods of tilling the soil for the methods that were in
vogue in a former time before science had invaded the realms of
agriculture, to the end that he may increase the yield of his
fields, make larger contributions to commerce, increase his
profits, and so be better able to gratify some of the higher
desires of his nature.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The automobile factory.</span>&mdash;Each
successive model in an automobile factory is a concrete
illustration of the process of making substitutions, and each
substituted part bears witness to a close scrutiny <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>48</span>of past
experiences as well as of the wants of prospective purchasers. The
self-starter was a want at first; but now it is a need, and,
therefore, a necessity. If the school would but make as careful
study of the boy&rsquo;s experiences and his wants as the
manufacturer does in the case of automobiles, and then would attach
the substitutions to these experiences and wants, the boy would
very soon find himself in happy possession of a self-starter which
would prove to be the very crown of school work. The automobile
manufacturer is both a psychologist and a politician.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Results of substitutions.</span>&mdash;As
a result of substitutions we have better roads, better houses,
better laws, cleaner streets, better fences, better machinery, more
sanitary conditions, and a higher type of conduct. We step to a
higher level upon the experiences of the past and make
substitutions as we move upward. The progress of civilization is
measured by the character of these substitutions and the rapidity
with which they are made. The people on the Isle of Marken make but
few substitutions, and these only at long intervals, and so they
are looked upon as curiosities among humans. In all our missionary
enterprises we are endeavoring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49"
name="page49"></a>49</span>to persuade the peoples among whom we
are working to make substitutions. Instead of their own, we would
have them accept our books, our styles of clothing, our plans of
government, our modes of living, our means of transportation, and,
in short, our standards of life. But, first of all, we must learn
their standards of life; otherwise we cannot proceed intelligently
or effectively in the line of substitutions. We must know their
language before we can teach them ours, and we must translate our
books into their language before we can hope to substitute our
books for theirs. All the substitutions we hope to make presuppose
a knowledge of their wants. Hence the methods of the missionary
bear a close analogy to the methods of the politician.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The Idealist.</span>&mdash;This is
equally true of the vitalized teacher. She is a practical idealist.
In the words of the poet, her reach is beyond her grasp, and this
proclaims her an idealist. In her capacity as a politician she
makes a close study of the wants of her constituents, both pupils
and parents, and so learns how best to articulate school work with
the interests of the community. She does not hold aloof from her
pupils or their homes, but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50"
name="page50"></a>50</span>studies them at close range, as do the
missionary and the politician. She lives among them and so learns
their language and their modes of thinking and living. Only so can
she come into sympathetic relations with them and be of greatest
service to them in promoting right substitutions. She finds one boy
surcharged with the instinct of pugnacity. This tendency manifests
itself both in school and at home. Her own conclusions are ratified
by the parents. He wants to fight. His whole nature cries aloud for
battle. In such a case, neither repression nor suppression will
avail. So she attaches a phase of school work to this native
disposition and gives his pugnacious instinct a fair field.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">An example.</span>&mdash;Enlisting him as
her champion in a tournament, she pits against him a doughty
antagonist in the form of a problem in arithmetic. In tones of
encouragement she gives the signal and the fight is on. The boy
pummels that problem as he would belabor a schoolmate on the
playground. His whole being is focused upon the adventure. And when
he has won his meed of praise, he feels himself a real champion.
The teacher merely substituted mind for hands in the contest and so
fell <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name=
"page51"></a>51</span>in with his notion that fighting is quite
right if only the cause is a worthy one. He is quick to see the
distinction and so makes the substitution with alacrity and with no
loss of self-respect. Ever after he disdains the vulgar brawl and
does not lose the fighting instinct. Thus the vitalized teacher by
knowing how to make substitutions wins for society a valiant
champion. If we multiply this example, we shall readily see how
such a teacher-politician deserves the distinction of being termed
a practical idealist.</p>

<h3>SUBLIME CHAOS</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Acquisitiveness.</span>&mdash;In fancy,
at least, we may attain a position over and far above the city of
London and from this vantage-place, with the aid of strong glasses,
watch a panorama that is both entrancing and bewildering. The scene
bewilders not alone by its scope, but still more by its complexity.
The scene is a shifting one, too, never the same in two successive
minutes. Here is Trafalgar Square, with its noble monument and the
guardian lions, reminding us of Nelson in what is accounted one of
the most heroic naval engagements recorded in history. As we look,
we reconstitute the scene, far away, in which he was conspicuous,
and reread in our books his stirring appeal to his men. Thence we
glance up Regent Street and see it thronged with equipages that
betoken wealth and luxury. Richly dressed people in great numbers
are moving to and fro and giving color to the picture. A shabby
garb cannot be made to fit into this picture. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>53</span>When it
appears, there is discord in the general harmony. All this motion
must have motives behind it somewhere; but we can only conjecture
the motives. We have only surface indications to guide us in our
quest for these. But we are reasonably certain that these people
are animated by the instinct of acquisition. They seem to want to
get things, and so come where things are to be had.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Desires for things
intangible.</span>&mdash;There are miles of vehicles of many kinds
wending their tortuous, sinuous ways in and out along streets that
radiate hither and thither. They stay their progress for a moment
and people emerge at Robinson&rsquo;s, at Selfridge&rsquo;s, at
Liberty&rsquo;s. Each of these is the Mecca of a thousand desires,
and faces beam with pleasure when they reappear. Some desire has
evidently been gratified. Others alight at the National Gallery and
enter its doors. When they come forth it is obvious that something
happened to them inside that building. The lines of care on their
faces are not so evident, and their step is more elastic and
buoyant. Their desires did not have tangible things as their
objectives as in the case of the people who entered the shops for
merchandise, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name=
"page54"></a>54</span>but their faces shine with a new light and,
therefore, their quest must have been successful. As we look, we
realize that desires for intangible things may be as acute as for
tangible ones, and that the gratification of these desires produces
equal satisfaction.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Westminster Abbey.</span>&mdash;Not far
away other throngs are invading Westminster Abbey. In those
historic and hallowed precincts they are communing with the Past,
the Present, and the Future. All about them is the sacred dust of
those who once wrought effectively in affairs of state and in the
realm of letters. History and literature have their shrine there,
and these people are worshipers at that shrine. All about them are
reminders of the Past, while the worshipers before the Cross direct
their thoughts to the Future. Earth and Heaven both send forth an
invitation for supreme interest in their thoughts and feelings.
History and literature call to them to emulate the achievements
whose monuments they see about them, while the Cross admonishes
them that these achievements are but temporal. Here they experience
a fulfillment of their desires. Their knowledge is broadened, and
their faith is lifted up. The Past thrills <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>55</span>them; the
Future inspires them; and thus the Present is far more worth
while.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">House of Parliament.</span>&mdash;Across
the way is Parliament, and this conjures up a long train of events
of vast import. The currents that flow out from this power-house
have encircled the globe. Here conquests have been planned that
electrified nations. Here have been generated vast armies and
navies as messengers of Desire. Here have been voted vast treasures
in execution of the desires of men for territorial extension and
national aggrandizement. These halls have resounded with the
eloquence of men who were striving to inoculate other men with the
virus of their desires; and the whole world has stood on tiptoe
awaiting the issue of this eloquence. Momentous scenes have been
enacted here, all emanating from the desires of men, and these
scenes have touched the lives of untold millions of people.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Commerce.</span>&mdash;We see the Thames
near by, teeming with ships from the uttermost corners of the
earth, and we think of commerce. We use the word glibly, but no
mind is able to comprehend its full import. We know that these
ships ply the seas, bearing food and clothing to the peoples who
live far away, but when we attempt to estimate the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>56</span>magnitude of
commerce, the mind confesses to itself that the problem is too
great. We may multiply the number of ships by their tonnage, but we
get, in consequence, an array of figures so great that they cease
to have any meaning for the finite mind. The best and most that
they can do for us is to make us newly aware that the people who
dwell in the jungles of Africa, who roam the pampas of South
America, who climb the Alps, the Rockies, the Andes, and the
Himalayas, all have desires that these ships are striving to
gratify.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Social intercourse.</span>&mdash;Going up
the river to Hampton Court we see people out for a holiday. There
are house-boats with elaborate and artistic fittings and
furnishings, and other craft of every sort that luxury can suggest.
One could imagine that none but fairies could stage such a scene.
The blending of colors, the easy dalliance, the rippling laughter,
the graceful feasting, and the eddying wavelets all conspire to
produce a scene that serves to emphasize the beauty of the shores.
Underneath this enchanting scene of variegated beauty we discover
the fundamental fact that man is a gregarious animal, that he not
only craves association with his kind but that playing with them
brings him into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name=
"page57"></a>57</span>more harmonious communion with them. In their
play they meet upon the plane of a common purpose and are thus
unified in spirit. Hence, all this beauty and gayety is serving a
beneficent purpose in the way of gratifying the inherent desire of
mankind for social intercourse.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The travel instinct.</span>&mdash;At
Charing Cross the commerce drama is re&euml;nacted, only here with
trains instead of boats, and, mainly, people instead of
merchandise. Here we see hurry and bustle, and hear the shriek of
the engine and the warning blast of the guard. Trains are going
out, trains are coming in. When the people step out upon the
platforms, they seem to know exactly whither they are bound. There
are porters all about to help them achieve their desires, and cabs
stand ready at the curb to do their bidding. Here is human
commerce, and the trains are the answer to the call of the human
family to see their own and other lands. These trains are swifter
and more agreeable for nomads than the camel of the desert or the
Conestoga wagon of the prairie. The nomadic instinct pulls and
pushes people away from their own door-yards; hence railways,
trains, engines, air brakes, telegraph lines, wireless apparatuses,
and all the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name=
"page58"></a>58</span>many other devices that the mind of man has
designed at the behest of this desire to roam about.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Monuments.</span>&mdash;Further down the
Thames we see Greenwich, which regulates the clocks for the whole
world, and furnishes the sea captain the talisman by which he may
know where he is. Over against St. Paul&rsquo;s is the Bank of
England, which for long years ruled the finances of the world.
Yonder is the Museum, the conservator of the ages. There is the
Rosetta Stone, which is the gateway of history; there the Elgin
Marbles, which proclaim the glory of the Greece that was; there the
palimpsests which recall an age when men had time to think; and
there the books of all time by means of which we can rethink the
big thoughts of men long since gone from sight. There are things
that men now call curiosities that mark the course of minds in
their struggles toward the light; and there are the sentiments of
lofty souls that will live in the hearts of men long after these
giant stones have crumbled.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Desire for pastoral
beauty.</span>&mdash;Beyond the city, in the alluring country
places, we see a landscape that delights the senses, ornate with
hedges, flowers, vine-clad cottages, highways of surpassing
smoothness, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name=
"page59"></a>59</span>fertile fields, and thrifty flocks and herds.
There are carts and wagons on the roads bearing the products of
field and garden to the marts of trade. Men, women, and children
zealously ply the hoe, the plow, or the shovel, abetting Nature in
her efforts to feed the hungry. In this pastoral scene there is
dignity, serenity, and latent power. Its beauty answers back to the
&aelig;sthetic nature of mankind, and nothing that is artificial
can ever supplant it in the way of gratifying man&rsquo;s desire
for the beautiful.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Economic
articulation.</span>&mdash;Through all the diversified phases of
this panorama there runs a fundamental principle of unity. There
are no collisions. In the economy of civilization the farmer is
co&ouml;rdinate with the artist, the artisan, and the tradesman.
But, if all men were farmers, the economic balance would be
disturbed. The railroad engineer is major because he is
indispensable. So, also, is the farmer, the legislator, the artist,
and the student. There is a degree of interdependence that makes
for economic harmony. The articulation of all the parts gives us an
economic whole.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Aspirations.</span>&mdash;This panorama
is a picture of life; and the school is life. Hence the panorama
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name=
"page60"></a>60</span>the school are identical; only the school is
larger than the panorama, even though the picture is reduced in
size to fit the frame of the school. The pupils in the school have
dreams and aspirations that reach far beyond the limits of the
picture of our fancy. And all these aspirations are a part of life
and so are indigenous in the vitalized school. And woe betide the
teacher who would abridge or repress these dreams and aspirations.
They are the very warp and woof of life, and the teacher who would
eliminate them would suppress life itself. That teacher is in sorry
business who would fit her pupils out with mental or spiritual
strait-jackets, or mold them to some conventional pattern, even
though it be her own. These pupils are the prototypes of the people
in our panorama, and are, therefore, animated by like inclinations
and desires.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Desire is fundamental.</span>&mdash;Here
is a boy who is hungry; he desires food. But so does the man who is
passing along the street. The man is focusing all his mental powers
upon the problem of how he shall procure food. The man&rsquo;s
problem is the boy&rsquo;s problem and each has a right to a
solution of his problem. The school&rsquo;s business is to help the
boy solve his problem and not to try to quench his <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>61</span>desire for food
or try to persuade him that no such desire exists. This desire is
one of the native dispositions to which the work of the school is
to attach itself. Desires are fundamental in the scheme of
education, the very tentacles that will lay hold upon the school
activities and render them effective. The teacher&rsquo;s large
task is to strengthen and nourish incipient desires and to cause
the pupil to hunger and thirst after the means of gratifying
them.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Innate tendencies.</span>&mdash;Each
pupil has a right to his inherent individuality. The school should
not only begin where the boy is, but should begin its work upon
what he is. Only so can it direct him toward what he ought to be.
If the boy would alight at the National Gallery in order to regale
himself with the masterpieces of art, why, pray, should the teacher
try to curtail this desire and force him into Westminster Abbey? If
she will accompany him into the Gallery and prove herself his
friend and guide among the treasures of art, she will, doubtless,
experience the joy of hearing him ask her to be his companion
through the Abbey later on. The Abbey is quite right in its way and
the boy must visit it soon or late, but to this particular boy the
Gallery comes first and he should be <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page62" name="page62"></a>62</span>led to the Abbey by way of the
Gallery. In school work the parties are all personally conducted,
but the rule is that a party is composed of but one person.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustration.</span>&mdash;The girl is
not to be condemned because she desires to visit the Selfridge shop
rather than the Museum. The teacher may rhapsodize upon the Museum
to the limit of her strength, but the girl is thinking of the
beautiful fabrics to be seen at the shop, and, especially, of the
delicious American ice cream that can be had nowhere else in
London. It is rather a poor teacher who cannot lead the girl to the
British Museum by way of Selfridge&rsquo;s. If the teacher finds
the task difficult, she would do well to traverse the route a few
times in advance. The ice cream will help rather than hinder when
they stand, at length, before the Rosetta Stone or read the
original letter to Mrs. Bixby. The store and the Museum are both in
the picture, and the teacher must determine which should come first
in the itinerary of this girl. The native dispositions and desires
will point out the way to the teacher.</p>
<p>The old-time schoolmaster was fond of setting as a copy in the
old-fashioned copy book &ldquo;All work <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>63</span>and no play
makes Jack a dull boy&rdquo;; but, later, when he caught Jack
playing he gave him a flogging, thus proving himself both
inconsistent and deficient in a knowledge of psychology and fair
play. If we are going to Greenwich we shall save time by taking the
longer journey by way of Hampton Court. As we disport ourselves
amid the beauties and gayeties of the Court we can prolong our
pleasures by anticipating Greenwich, and so make our play the
anteroom of our work.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Variety in excellence.</span>&mdash;In
the vitalized school we shall find each pupil eager in his quest of
food for the hunger he feels, and the teacher rejoicing in the
development of his individuality. She would not have all her pupils
attain the same level even of excellence. They are different, and
she would have them so. Nor would she have her school exemplify the
kind of order that is to be found in a gallery of statues. Her
school is a place of life, eager, yearning, pulsating life, and not
a place of dead and deadening silence. Her pupils have diversified
tastes and desires and, in consequence, diversified activities, but
work is the golden cord that binds them in a healthy and healthful
unity. This is sublime chaos, a busy, happy throng, all working at
full strength <span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name=
"page64"></a>64</span>at tasks that are worth while, and all
animated by hopes and aspirations that reach out to the very limits
of space.</p>

<h3>DEMOCRACY</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">A conflict.</span>&mdash;There was a
fight on a railway train&mdash;a terrific fight. The conductor and
two other Americans were battling against ten or more foreigners.
These foreigners had come aboard the train at a mining town en
route to the city for a holiday. The train had hardly got under
way, after the stop, when the fight was on. The battle raged back
and forth from one car to the other across the platform amid the
shouts and cursing of men and the screams of women. Bloody faces
attested the intensity of the conflict. One foreigner was knocked
from the train, but no account was taken of him. The train sped on
and the fight continued. Nor did its violence abate until the train
reached the next station, where the conductor summoned
re&euml;nforcements and invoked the majesty of the law in the form
of an officer. The affray, from first to last, was most depressing
and gave to the unwilling witness a feeling that civilization is
something of a misnomer and that men are inherently ferocious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name=
"page66"></a>66</span><span class=
"paraHead">Misconceptions.</span>&mdash;More mature reflection,
however, served to modify this judgment, and the application of
some philosophy resolved the distressing combat into a relatively
simple proposition. The conductor and his assistants were fighting
for their conception of order, and their opponents were fighting
for their conception of manhood. Reduced to its primal elements,
the fight was the result of a dual misconception. The conductor was
battling to vindicate his conception of order; the foreigners were
battling to vindicate their conception of the rights of men in a
democracy. Neither party to the contest understood the other, and
each one felt himself to be on the defensive. Neither one would
have confessed himself the aggressor, and yet each one was invading
the supposed rights of the other. Judicial consideration could
readily have averted the whole distressing affair.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Foreign concept of
democracy.</span>&mdash;The foreigners had come to our country with
roseate dreams of democracy. To their conception, this is the land
where every man is the equal of every other man; where equal rights
and privileges are vouchsafed to all men without regard to
nationality, position, or possessions; where there is no faintest
hint of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name=
"page67"></a>67</span>caste system; and where there are no possible
lines of demarcation. Their disillusionment on that train was swift
and severe, and the observer could not but wonder what was their
conception of a democracy as they walked about the streets of the
city or gave attention to their bruised faces. Their dreams of
freedom and equal rights must have seemed a mockery. They must have
felt that they had been lured into a trap by some agency of cruelty
and injustice. After such an experience they must have been
unspeakably homesick for their native land.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">&ldquo;Melting
pot.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;Their primary trouble arose from the fact
that they had not yet achieved democracy, but had only a hazy
theoretical conception of its true meaning. Nor did the conductor
give them any assistance. On the contrary he pushed them farther
away into the realm of theory, and rendered them less susceptible
to the influence of the feeling for democracy. Before these
foreigners can become thoroughly assimilated they must know this
feeling by experience; and until this experience is theirs they
cannot live comfortably or harmoniously in our democracy. To do
this effectively is one of the large tasks that confront the
American <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name=
"page68"></a>68</span>school and society as a whole. If we fail
here, the glory of democracy will be dimmed. All Americans share
equally in the responsibility of this task. The school, of course,
must assume its full share of this responsibility if it would fully
deserve the name of melting pot.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Learning democracy.</span>&mdash;Meeting
this responsibility worthily is not the simple thing that many seem
to conceive it to be. If it were, then any discussion appertaining
to the teaching of democracy would be superfluous. This subject of
democracy is, in fact, the most difficult subject with which the
school has to do, and by far the most important. Its supreme
importance is due to the fact that all the pupils expect to live in
a democracy, and, unless they learn democracy, life cannot attain
to its maximum of agreeableness for them nor can they make the
largest possible contributions to the well-being of society. It has
been said that the seventeenth century saw Versailles; the
eighteenth century saw the Earth; and the nineteenth century saw
Humanity. Then the very pertinent question is asked, &ldquo;Which
century will see Life?&rdquo; We who love our country and our form
of government fondly hope that we may be the first to see Life,
and, if <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name=
"page69"></a>69</span>this privilege falls to our lot, we must come
to see life through the medium of democracy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The vitalized school a
democracy.</span>&mdash;Life seems to be an abstract something to
many people, but it must become concrete before they can really see
it as it is. Democracy is a means, therefore, of transforming
abstract life into concrete life, and so we are to come into a
fuller comprehension of life through the gateway of democracy. The
vitalized school is a laboratory of life and, at the same time, it
is the most nearly perfect exemplification of democracy. The nearer
its approach to perfection in exemplifying the spirit and workings
of a democracy, the larger service it renders society. If the
outflow from the school into society is a high quality of
democracy, the general tone of society will be improved. If society
deteriorates, the school may not be wholly at fault, but it
evidently is unable to supply to society re&euml;nforcement in such
quantity and of such quality as will keep the level up to
normal.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Responsibility of the
individual.</span>&mdash;In society each individual raises or
lowers the level of democracy according to what he is and does. The
idler fails to make any contributions to the well-being of society
and thus lowers the average of citizenship. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>70</span>The trifler and
dawdler lower the level of democracy by reason of their
inefficiency. They may exercise their right to vote but fail to
exercise their right to act the part of efficient citizens. If all
citizens emulated their example, democracy would become inane and
devitalized. Tramps, burglars, feeble-minded persons, and
inebriates lower the level of democracy because of their failure to
render their full measure of service, and because, in varying
degrees, they prey upon the resources of society and thus add to
its burdens. Self-reliance, self-support, self-respect, as well as
voting, are among the rights that all able-bodied citizens must
exercise before democracy can come into its rightful heritage.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The function of the
school.</span>&mdash;All this and much more the schools must teach
effectively so that it shall be thoroughly enmeshed in the social
consciousness or their output will reveal a lack of those qualities
that make for the larger good of democratic society. Democracy must
be grooved into habits of thought and action or the graduates of
the schools will fall short of achieving the highest plane of
living in the community. They will not be in harmony with their
environment, and friction will ensue, which will reduce, in some
degree, the level of democracy. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page71" name="page71"></a>71</span>Hence, the large task of the
school is to inculcate the habit of democracy with all that the
term implies. Twelve years are none too long for this important
work, even under the most favorable conditions and under the
direction of the most skillful teaching. Indeed, civic economy will
be greatly enhanced if, in the twelve years, the schools accomplish
this one big purpose.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Manifestations of democratic
spirit.</span>&mdash;We may not be able to resolve democracy into
its constituent elements, but the spirit that is attuned to
democracy is keenly alive to its manifestations. The spirit so
attuned is quick to detect any slightest discord in the democratic
harmony. This is especially true in the school democracy. A
discordant note affects the entire situation and militates against
effective procedure. In the school democracy we look for a series
and system of compromises,&mdash;for a yielding of minor matters
that major ones may be achieved. We look for concessions that will
make for the comfort and progress of the entire body, and we
experience disappointment if we fail to discover some pleasure in
connection with these concessions. We expect to see good will
banishing selfishness and every semblance of monopoly. We expect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>72</span>to
find every pupil glad to share the time and strength of the teacher
with his fellows even to the point of generosity, and to find joy
in so doing. We expect to find each pupil eager to deposit all his
attainments and capabilities as assets of the school and to find
his chief joy in the success of all that the school represents.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Obstacles in the path.</span>&mdash;But
it is far easier to depict democracy than to teach it. In fact, the
teacher is certain to encounter obstacles, and many of these have
their source in American homes. Indeed, some of the most fertile
sources of discord in the school may be traced to a misconception
of democracy on the part of the home. One of these misconceptions
is a species of anarchy, which appropriates to itself the gentler
name of democracy. But, none the less, it is anarchy. It disdains
all law and authority, treads under foot the precepts of the home
and the school, flouts the counsels of parents and teachers, and is
self-willed, obstinate, and defiant. Democracy obeys the law;
anarchy scorns it. Democracy respects the rights of others, anarchy
overrides them. Democracy exalts good will; anarchy exalts
selfishness. Democracy respects the Golden Rule; anarchy respects
nothing, not even itself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name=
"page73"></a>73</span><span class=
"paraHead">Anarchy.</span>&mdash;When this spirit of anarchy gains
access to the school, it is not easily eradicated for the reason
that the home is loath to recognize it as anarchy, and resents any
such implication on the part of the school. The father may be quite
unable to exercise any control over the boy, but he is reluctant to
admit the fact to the teacher. Such a boy is an anarchist and no
sophistry can gloss the fact. What he needs is a liberal
application of monarchy to fit him for democracy. He should read
the Old Testament as a preparation for an appreciative perusal of
the New Testament. If the home cannot generate in him due respect
for constituted authority, then the school must do so, or he will
prove a menace to society and become a destructive rather than a
constructive agency. Here we have a tense situation. Anarchy is
running riot in the home; the home is arrayed against the attempts
of the school to correct the disorder; and Democracy is standing
expectant to see what will be done.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Snobbery.</span>&mdash;Scarcely less
inimical to democracy than anarchy is snobbery. The former is
violent, while the latter is insidious. Both poison the source of
the stream of democracy. If the home instills into the minds of
children the notion of inherent <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page74" name="page74"></a>74</span>superiority, they will carry
this into the school and it will produce a discord. A farmer and a
tenant had sons of the same age. These lads played together, never
thinking of superiority or inferiority. Now the son of the tenant
is president of one of the great universities, and the son of the
proprietor is a janitor in one of the buildings of that university.
Democracy presents to view many anomalies, and the school age is
quite too early for anything approaching the caste system or
snobbery. The time may come when the rich man&rsquo;s son will
consider it an honor to drive the car for his impecunious
classmate.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Restatement.</span>&mdash;It needs to be
repeated, therefore, that democracy is the most difficult subject
which the school is called upon to teach, not only because it is
difficult in itself, but also because of the attitude of many homes
that profess democracy but do not practice it. To the influence of
such homes one may trace the exodus of many children from the
schools. The parents want things done in their way or not at all,
and so withdraw their children to vindicate their own autocracy.
They are willing to profit by democracy but are unwilling to help
foster its growth. They not only lower the level of democracy but
even compel their children <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75"
name="page75"></a>75</span>to lower it still more. The teacher may
yearn for the children and the children for the teacher, but the
home is inexorable and sacrifices the children to a misconception
of democracy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Co&ouml;peration.</span>&mdash;Democracy
does not mean fellowship, but it does mean co&ouml;peration. It
means that people in all walks of life are animated by the common
purpose to make all their activities contribute to the general good
of society. It means that the railroad president may shake hands
with the brakeman and talk with him, man to man, encouraging him to
aspire to promotion on merit. It means that this brakeman may
become president of the road with no scorn for the stages through
which he passed in attaining this position. It means that he may
understand and sympathize with the men in his employ without
fraternizing with them. It means that every boy may aspire to a
place higher than his father has attained with no loss of affection
for him. It does not mean either sycophancy or truculence, but
freedom to every individual to make the most of himself and so help
others to make the most of themselves.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The democratic
teacher.</span>&mdash;Democracy is learned not from books but from
the democratic spirit that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76"
name="page76"></a>76</span>obtains in the school. If the teacher is
surcharged with democracy, her radiating spirit sends out currents
into the life of each pupil, and the spirit of democracy thus
generated in them fuses them into homogeneity. Thus they become
democratic by living in the atmosphere of democracy, as the boy
grew into the likeness of the Great Stone Face.</p>

<h3>PATRIOTISM</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Patriotism as a working
principle.</span>&mdash;The vitalized school generates and fosters
patriotism, not merely as a sentiment, but more particularly as a
working principle. Patriotism has in it a modicum of sentiment, to
be sure, as do religion, education, the home, and civilization; but
sentiment alone does not constitute real or true patriotism. The
man who shouts for the flag but pursues a course of conduct that
brings discredit upon the name of his country, belies the sentiment
that his shouting would seem to express. The truly patriotic man
feels that he owes to his country and his race his whole
self,&mdash;his mind, his time, and his best efforts,&mdash;and the
payment of this obligation spells life to him. Thus he inevitably
interprets patriotism in terms of industry, economy, thrift, and
the full conservation of time and energy, that he may render a good
account of his stewardship to his country.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Spelling as patriotism.</span>&mdash;With
this broad conception <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name=
"page78"></a>78</span>in mind the teacher elevates patriotism to
the rank of a motive and proceeds to organize all the school
activities in consonance with this conception. Actuated by this
high motive the pupils, in time, come to look upon correct spelling
not only as a comfort and a convenience, but also as a form of
patriotism in that it is an exponent of intelligent observation and
as such wins respect and commendation from people at home and
people abroad. Or, to put the case negatively, if we were all
deficient in the matter of spelling, the people of other lands
would hold us up to ridicule because of this defect; but if we are
expert in the art of spelling, they have greater respect for us and
for our schools. Hence, such a simple matter as spelling tends to
invest the flag of our country with better and fuller significance.
Thus spelling becomes woven into the life processes, not as a mere
task of the school, but as a privilege vouchsafed to every one who
yearns to see his country win distinction.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Patriotism a determining
motive.</span>&mdash;In like manner the teacher runs the entire
gamut of school studies and shows how each one may become a
manifestation of patriotism. If she has her pupils <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>79</span>exchange
letters with pupils in the schools of other countries, they see, at
once, that their spelling, their writing, and their composition
will all be carefully assessed in the formation of an estimate of
ourselves and our schools. It is evident, therefore, that the
pupils will give forth their best efforts in all these lines that
the country they represent may appear to the best advantage. In
such an exercise the motive of patriotism will far outweigh in
importance the motive of grades. Besides, the letters are written
to real people about real life, and, hence, life and patriotism
become synonymous in their thinking, and all their school work
becomes more vital because of their patriotism.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">History.</span>&mdash;In the study of
history, the pupils readily discover that the men and women who
have given distinction to their respective countries have done so,
in the main, by reason of their attainments in science, in letters,
and in statesmanship. They are led to think of Goethals in the
field of applied mathematics; of Burbank in the realm of botany; of
Edison in physics; of Scott and Burns in literature; of Max
M&uuml;ller in philology; of Schliemann in arch&aelig;ology; of
Washington and Lincoln in the realm of statesmanship; and of
Florence Nightingale <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name=
"page80"></a>80</span>and Clara Barton in philanthropy. They
discover that France deemed it an honor to have Erasmus as her
guest so long as he found it agreeable to live in that country, and
that many countries vied with one another in claiming Homer as
their own. Phillips Brooks was a patriot, not alone because of his
profession of love for his country, but because of what he did that
added luster to the name of his country.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Efficiency.</span>&mdash;The study of
physiology and hygiene affords a wide field for the contemplation
and practice of patriotic endeavor. The care of the body is a
patriotic exercise in that it promotes health and vigor, and these
underlie efficiency. Anything short of efficiency is unpatriotic
because it amounts to a subtraction from the possible best that may
be done to advance the interests of society. The shiftless man is
not a patriot, nor yet the man who enervates his body by practices
that render him less than efficient. The intemperate man may shout
lustily at sight of the flag, but his noise only proclaims his lack
of real patriotism. An honest day&rsquo;s work would redound far
more to the glory of his country than his noisy protestations.
Seeing that behind every deliberate action there lies a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name=
"page81"></a>81</span>motive, the higher the motive the more noble
will be the action. If, then, we can achieve temperance through the
motive of patriotism, society will be the beneficiary, not only of
temperance itself, but also of many concomitant benefits.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Temperance.</span>&mdash;Temperance may
be induced, of course, through the motives of economy, good health,
and the like, but the motive of patriotism includes all these and,
therefore, stands at the summit. Waste, in whatever form, is
evermore unpatriotic. Conservation is patriotism, whether of
natural resources, human life, human energy, or time. The
intemperate man wastes his substance, his energies, his
opportunities, his self-respect, and his moral fiber. Very often,
too, he becomes a charge upon society and abrogates the right of
his family to live comfortably and agreeably. Hence, he must be
accounted unpatriotic. If all men in our country were such as he,
our land would be derided by the other nations of the world. He
brings his country into disrepute instead of glorifying it because
he does less than his full share in contributing to its well-being.
He renders himself less than a typical American and brings reproach
upon his country instead of honor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name=
"page82"></a>82</span><span class=
"paraHead">Sanitation.</span>&mdash;One of the chief variants of
the general subject of physiology and hygiene is sanitation, and
this, even yet, affords a field for aggressive and constructive
patriotism. Grime and crime go hand in hand; but, as a people, we
have been somewhat slow in our recognition of this patent truth.
Patriotism as well as charity should begin at home, and the man who
professes a love for his country should make that part of his
country which he calls his home so sanitary and so attractive that
it will attest the sincerity of his profession. If he loves his
country sincerely, he must love his back yard, and what he really
loves he will care for. It does him no credit to have the flag
floating above a home that proclaims his shiftlessness. His feeling
for sanitation, attractiveness, and right conditions as touching
his own home surroundings will expand until it includes his
neighborhood, his county, his State, and his entire country.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">A typical patriot.</span>&mdash;A typical
patriot is the busy, intelligent, frugal, cultured housewife whose
home is her kingdom and who uses her powers to make that kingdom
glorious. She regrets neither the time nor the effort that is
required to make her home clean, artistic, and comfortable. She
places <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name=
"page83"></a>83</span>upon it the stamp of her character, industry,
and good taste. She supplies it with things that delight the senses
and point the way to culture. To such a home the crude and the
bizarre are a profanation. She administers her home as a sacred
trust in the interests of her family and never for exhibition
purposes. Her home is an expression of herself, and her children
will carry into life the standards that she inculcates through the
agency of the home. Life is better for the family and for the
community because her home is what it is, and, in consequence, her
patriotism is far-reaching in its influence. If all homes were such
as this, our country would be exploited as representing the highest
plane of civilization the world has yet attained. The vitalized
teacher is constantly striving to have this standard of home and
home life become the standard of her pupils.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Mulberry Bend.</span>&mdash;In striking
contrast with this home are conditions in Mulberry Bend, New York,
as described by a writer thoroughly conversant with conditions as
they were until recently&mdash;conditions, however, now much
bettered: &ldquo;These alleys, running from nowhere to nowhere,
alongside cellars where the light never enters and where nothing
can <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name=
"page84"></a>84</span>live but beast-men and beast-women and rats;
behind foul rookeries where skulk the murderer and the abandoned
tramp; beside hideous plague-spots where the stench is
overpowering&mdash;Bottle Alley, where the rag-pickers pile their
bags of stinking stuff, and the Whyo Roost where evil-visaged
beings prowl about, hunting for prey; dozens of alleys winding in
and out and intersecting, so that the beast may slay his prey, and
hide in the jungle, and be safe; these foul alleys&mdash;who shall
picture them, or explore their depths, or describe their
wretchedness and their hideousness?&hellip; Upon the doorsteps
weary mothers are nursing little babies who will never know the
meaning of innocent childhood, but will be versed in the immoral
lore of the Underworld before they learn their alphabet. Ragged
children covered with filth play about the pushcarts and the horses
in the street, while their mothers chatter in greasy doorways, or
shout from upper windows into the hordes below, or clatter about
creaky floors, preparing the foul mess of tainted edibles which
constitutes a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many other phases of this gruesome picture this author
deals, and then concludes with the following: &ldquo;But in the
rookeries which, like their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"
name="page85"></a>85</span>inmates, skulk and hide out of sight in
the crowded street; in these ramshackle structures which line the
back alleys, and there breed their human vermin amid dirt and
rags&mdash;in these there is no direct sunlight throughout the long
year. Rookeries close to the front windows, shutting out light and
air, and rookeries close to the rear windows, and rookeries close
to each side, and never a breath of fresh air to ventilate one of
these holes wherein men and women and children wallow in dirt, and
live and fight and drink and die, and finally give way to others of
their kind.&rdquo; So long as such conditions as these continue in
our country, sanitation as a manifestation of patriotism will not
have done its perfect work, and the stars and stripes of our flag
will lack somewhat of their rightful luster.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Patriotism in daily
life.</span>&mdash;When the influences of hygiene and of home
economics, taught as life processes and not merely as prerequisites
for graduation, by teachers who regard them as forms of
patriotism,&mdash;when these influences have percolated to every
nook and cranny of our national life,&mdash;to the homes, the
streets and alleys, the farms, the shops, the factories, and the
mines, such conditions as these will disappear, and we as a nation
shall <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name=
"page86"></a>86</span>then have a clearer warrant for our
profession of patriotic interest in and devotion to the welfare of
our country as a whole. But so long as we can look upon insanitary
conditions without a shudder; so long as we permit dirt to breed
disease and crime; so long as we make our streams the dumping
places for d&eacute;bris; so long as we tolerate ugliness where
beauty should obtain; and so long as our homes and our farms betray
the spirit of shiftlessness,&mdash;so long shall we have occasion
to blush when we look at our flag and confess our dereliction of
our high privilege of patriotism.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The American
restaurant.</span>&mdash;Perhaps no single detail of the customs
that obtain in our country impresses a cultivated foreigner more
unfavorably than the r&eacute;gime in our popular restaurants. The
noise, the rattle and clatter and bang, the raucous calling of
orders, and the hurry and confusion give him the impression that we
are content to have feeding places where we might have eating
places. He regards all that he sees and hears as being less than
proper decorum, less than a high standard of intelligence, less
than refined cultivation, and less than agencies that contribute to
the graces of life. He marvels that we have not yet attained the
conception <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name=
"page87"></a>87</span>that partaking of food amounts to a gracious
and delightful ceremony rather than a gastronomic orgy. His
surprise is not limited to the people who administer these
establishments, but extends to the people who patronize them. He
marvels that the patrons do not seek out places where there is
quiet, and serenity, and pleasing decorum. He returns to his own
land wondering if the noisy restaurant is typical of American
civilization. He may not know that the study of domestic science in
our schools has not had time to attain its full fruition in the way
of inculcating a lofty conception of life in the dining room.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Thrift as
patriotism.</span>&mdash;Another important phase of patriotism is
thrift; and here, again, we have come short of realizing our
possibilities. There are far too many people who have failed to lay
in store against times of emergency, far too many who care only for
to-day with slight regard for to-morrow. Moreover, there are far
too many who, despite sound bodies, are dependents, contributing
nothing to the resources of society, but constantly preying upon
those resources. There are in our country not fewer than one
hundred thousand tramps, and by some the number has been estimated
at a half-million. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name=
"page88"></a>88</span>If this vast army of dependents could be
transferred to the ranks of producers, tilling our fields,
harvesting our crops, constructing our highways of travel,
redeeming our waste places, and beautifying our streams, life would
be far more agreeable both for them and for the rest of our people.
They would become self-supporting and so would win self-respect;
they would subtract their number from the number of those who live
at public expense; and they would make contributions to the general
store. They would thus relieve society of the incubus of their
dependence, and largely increase the number of our people who are
self-supporting.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Some contrasts.</span>&mdash;We are
making some progress in the line of thrift through our school
savings and postal savings, but we have not yet attained to a
national conception of thrift as an element of patriotism. This is
one of the large yet inspiring privileges of the vitalized school.
Thrift is so intimately identified with life that they naturally
combine in our thinking, and we have only to reach the conception
that our mode of life is the measure of our patriotism in order to
realize that thrift and patriotism are in large measure identical.
The industrious, frugal, thrifty man is patriotic; the unthrifty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name=
"page89"></a>89</span>lazy, shiftless man is unpatriotic. The one
ennobles and honors his country; the other dishonors and degrades
his country.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;If the foregoing
conclusions are valid, and to every thoughtful person they must
seem well-nigh axiomatic, then the school has a wide field of
usefulness in the way of inculcating a loftier and broader
conception of patriotism. The teacher who worthily fills her place
in the vitalized school will give the boys and girls in her care
such a conception of patriotism as will give direction, potency,
and significance to every school activity and lift these activities
out of the realm of drudgery into the realm of privilege. Her
pupils will be made to feel that what they are doing for
themselves, their school, and their homes, they are doing for the
honor and glory of their country.</p>

<h3>WORK AND LIFE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Tom Sawyer.</span>&mdash;Tom Sawyer was
one of the most effective teachers that has figured in the pages of
the books; and yet we still regard Mark Twain as merely the prince
of humorists. He was that, of course, but much more; and some day
we shall read his books in quest of pedagogical wisdom and shall
not be disappointed. It will be recalled that Tom Sawyer sat on the
top of a barrel and munched apples while his boy companions
whitewashed the fence in his stead. Tom achieved this triumph
because he knew how to emancipate work from the plane of drudgery
and exalt it to the plane of a privilege. Indeed, it loomed so
large as a privilege that the other boys were eager to barter the
treasures of their pockets in exchange for this privilege. And
never did a fence receive such a whitewashing! There wasn&rsquo;t
fence enough and, therefore, the process must needs be repeated
again and again. The best part of the entire episode was that
everybody <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name=
"page92"></a>92</span>was happy, Tom included. Tom was happy in
seeing his plan work, and the other boys were happy because they
were doing work that Tom had caused them to become eager to do.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Work as a privilege.</span>&mdash;To make
work seem a privilege is a worthy task for the school to set before
itself, and if it but achieves this it will prove itself worth all
it costs. At first thought, it seems a stupendous task, and so it
is. But Tom Sawyer accomplished it in an easy, natural way, with no
parade or bombast. He had habit and tradition to contend against,
just as the school has, but he overbore these obstacles and won the
contest. Some of those boys, before that morning, may have thought
it ignoble to perform menial tasks; but Tom soon overcame that
feeling and led them to feel that only an artist can whitewash a
fence properly. Some of them may have been interpreting life as
having a good time, but, under the tutorage of Tom, they soon came
to feel that having a good time means whitewashing a fence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The persistency of habit.</span>&mdash;In
striving to exalt and ennoble work, the school runs counter to
habits of thought that have been formed in the home, and these
habits prove stubborn. The home has so <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page93" name="page93"></a>93</span>long imposed work as a task
that the school finds it difficult to make it seem a privilege. The
father and mother have so often complained of their work, in the
presence of their children, that all work comes to assume the
aspect of a hardship, if not a penalty. It often happens, too, that
the parents encourage their children to think that education
affords immunity from work, and the children attend school with
that notion firmly implanted in their minds. They seem to think
that when they have achieved an education they will receive their
reward in the choicest gifts that Fortune has to bestow, and that
their only responsibility will be to indicate their choices.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Misconceptions of
work.</span>&mdash;Still further, when children enter school imbued
with this conception of work, they feel that the work of the school
is imposed upon them as a task from which they would fain be free.
If their parents had only been as wise as Tom Sawyer and had set up
motives before them in connection with their home activities and
thus exalted all their work to the plane of privilege, the work of
the school would be greatly simplified. It is no slight task to
eradicate this misconception of work, but somehow it must be done
before the work <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name=
"page94"></a>94</span>of the school can get on. Until this is done,
the work of the school will be done grudgingly instead of
buoyantly, and work that is done under compulsion is never joyous
work. Nor will work that is done under compulsion ever be done in
full measure, as the days of slavery clearly prove.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;Life and work
are synonymous, and no amount or form of sophistry can abrogate
their relation. The man who does not work does not have real life,
as the invalid will freely witness. The tramp on the highway
manages to exist, but he does not really live, no matter what his
philosophy may be. Many children interpret life to mean plenty of
money and nothing to do, but this conception merely proves that
they are children with childish misconceptions. They see the
railway magnate riding in his private car and conceive his life to
be one of ease and luxury. They do not realize that the private car
affords him the opportunity to do more and better work. They see
the president of the bank sitting in his private office and imagine
that he is idle, not realizing that his mind is busy with problems
of great magnitude, problems that would appall his subordinates.
They cannot know, as he sits there, that he is projecting his
thoughts into far-off <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name=
"page95"></a>95</span>lands, and is watching the manifold and
complex processions of commerce in their relations to the world of
finance.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Concrete examples.</span>&mdash;They see
the architect in his luxurious apartments, but do not realize that
his brain is directing every movement of a thousand men who are
causing a colossal building to tower toward the sky. They see a
Grant sitting beneath a tree in apparent unconcern, but do not know
that he is bearing the responsibility of the movements of a vast
army. They see the pastor in his study among his books, but do not
know the travail of spirit that he experiences in his yearning for
his parishioners. They see the farmer sitting at ease in the shade,
but do not know that he is visualizing every detail of his farm,
the men at their tasks, the flocks and herds, the crops, the
streams, the machinery, the fences, and the orchards and vineyards.
They see the master of the ship, standing on the bridge clad in his
smart uniform, and imagine that he is merely enjoying the sea
breezes the same as themselves, not knowing that his thoughts are
concentrated upon the safety of his hundreds of passengers and his
precious cargo.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The potency of mental
work.</span>&mdash;Only by experience <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page96" name="page96"></a>96</span>may children come to know that
work may be mental as well as physical, and the school is charged
with the responsibility of affording this experience. Through
experience they will come to know that mind transcends matter, and
that in life the body yields obedience to the behests of the mind.
They will come to know that mental work is more far-reaching than
physical work, in that a single mind plans the work for a thousand
hands. They will learn that mental work has redeemed the world from
its primitive condition and is making life more agreeable even if
more complex. They will come to see the mind busy in its work of
tunneling mountains, building canals and railways, navigating
oceans, and exploring the sky. They will come to realize that
mental work has produced our libraries, designed our machinery,
made our homes more comfortable and our fields more fertile.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Work a blessing.</span>&mdash;As a
knowledge of all these things filters into their minds, their
conception of life broadens, and they see more and more clearly
that life and work are fundamentally identical. They see that work
directs the streams of life and gives to life point, potency, and
significance. They soon see that knowledge is power only because it
is the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name=
"page97"></a>97</span>agency that generates power, and that
knowledge touches life at every point. They will come to realize
that work is the one great luxury in life, and that education is
designed to increase the capacity for work in order that people may
indulge in this luxury more abundantly. The more work one can do,
the more life one has; and the better the work one can do, the
higher the quality of that life. They learn that the adage
&ldquo;Work to live and live to work&rdquo; is no fiction but a
reality.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Work and enjoyment.</span>&mdash;The
school, therefore, becomes to them a workshop of life, and unless
it is that, it is not a worthy school. It is not a something
detached from life, but, rather, an integral part of life and
therefore a place and an occasion for work. The school is the
Burning Bush of work that is to grow into the Tree of Life. But
life ought to teem with joy in order to be at its best, and never
be a drag. Work, therefore, being synonymous with life, should be a
joyous experience, even though it taxes the powers to the utmost.
If the child comes to the work of the school as the galley-slave
goes to his task, there is a lack of adjustment and balance
somewhere, and a readjustment is necessary. It matters not that a
boy spends two hours over a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"
name="page98"></a>98</span>problem in arithmetic if only he enjoys
himself during the time. But, if he works two hours merely to get a
passing grade or to escape punishment, the time thus spent does not
afford him the pleasure that rightfully belongs to him, and some
better motive should be supplied.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s
problem.</span>&mdash;The teacher&rsquo;s mission is not to make
school work easy, but, rather, to make the hardest work alluring
and agreeable. Here, again, she may need to take counsel with Tom
Sawyer. Whitewashing a fence is quite as hard work as solving a
problem in decimals or cube root. Much depends upon the mental
attitude of the boy, and this in turn depends upon the skill of the
teacher and her fertility of mind in supplying motives.
Whitewashing a fence causes the arms to grow weary and the back to
ache, but the boys recked not of that. On the contrary, they
clamored for more of the same kind of work. This same spirit
characterizes the work of the vitalized school. The pupils live as
joyously in the schoolroom as they do outside, and the harder the
work the greater their joy.</p>
<p>When work is made a privilege by the expert teacher, school
procedure becomes well-nigh automatic and there is never any
occasion for nagging, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name=
"page99"></a>99</span>hectoring, or badgering. Such things are
abnormal in life and no less so in the vitalized school. They are a
confession on the part of the teacher that she has reached the
limit of her resources. She admits that she cannot do what Tom
Sawyer did so well, and so proclaims her inability to articulate
life and work effectively.</p>

<h3>WORDS AND THEIR CONTENT</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Initial statement.</span>&mdash;Life and
words are so closely interwoven that we have only to study words
with care in order to achieve an apprehension of life. Indeed,
education may be defined as the process of enlarging the content of
words. No two of us speak the same language even though we use the
same words. The schoolboy and the savant speak of education, using
the same word, but the boy has only the faintest conception of the
meaning of the word as used by the savant. We must know the content
of the words that are used before we can understand one another,
either in speaking or in writing. For one man, a word is big with
meaning; for another, the same word is so small as to be well-nigh
meaningless. To the ignorant boor, the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;
means far less than the three R&rsquo;s, while to the scholar the
word includes languages, ancient and modern, mathematics through
many volumes, sciences that analyze the dewdrop, determine the
weight of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name=
"page101"></a>101</span>earth and the distances and movements of
the planets, history from the Rosetta Stone to the latest
presidential election, and philosophy from Plato to the scholar of
to-day.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The word
&ldquo;education.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;And yet both these men spell
and pronounce the word alike. The ignorant man has only the
faintest glimmering of the scholar&rsquo;s meaning of the word when
he speaks or writes it. Still the word is in common use, and people
who use it are wont to think that their conception of its meaning
is universal. If the boor could follow the expansion of the word as
it is invested with greater and greater content, he would, in time,
understand Aristotle, Shakespeare, Gladstone, and Max M&uuml;ller.
And, understanding these men, he would come to know philosophy,
literature, and language, and so would come to appreciate more
fully what education really is. In contemplating the expansion of
the word, one might easily visualize the ever widening circle
produced by throwing a pebble into a pool; but a better conception
would be the expansion of a balloon when it is being inflated. This
comparison enables one to realize that education enlarges as a
sphere rather than as a circle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name=
"page102"></a>102</span><span class="paraHead">The scholar&rsquo;s
concept of the sea.</span>&mdash;The six-year-old can give the
correct spelling of the word <em>sea</em> as readily as the sage,
but the sage has spent a lifetime in putting content into the word.
For him, the word epitomizes his life history. Through its magic
leading he retraces his journeys through physiography and geology,
watching the sea wear away two thousand feet of the Appalachian
Mountains and spread the detritus over vast areas, making the great
fertile corn and wheat belt of our country. He knows that this
section produces, annually, such a quantity of corn as would
require for transportation a procession of teams that would
encircle the earth nine times, at the equator, and he interprets
all this as sea. The word leads him, also, through the mazes and
mysteries of meteorology, revealing to him the origin of the rain,
the snow, the dew, and the frost, with all the wonders of
evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Further illustration.</span>&mdash;He can
discern the sea in every blade of grass, in every leaf, and in
every flower. In the composition of his own body, he finds that
ninety per cent of it is sea. He finds his heart pumping the sea
through his veins and arteries as a vital part of the life process;
and through the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name=
"page103"></a>103</span>power of capillary attraction, the sea is
coursing through every hair of his head. In the food upon his
table, the meat, the bread, the milk, the vegetables, and the
fruits, he finds the sea. Not his poetry, but his science follows
the raindrop from the roof to the rivulet, on to the river, then to
the ocean, then into vapor and on into rain down into the earth,
then up into the tree, out into the orange, until it finally
reappears as a drop of juice upon the rosy lip of his little
six-year-old.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s
conception.</span>&mdash;Whether the child ever wins the large
conception of the sea that her father has depends, in part, upon
the father himself, but, in a still larger degree, upon her
teacher. If the teacher thinks of the sea merely as a word to be
spelled, or defined, or parsed, that she may inscribe marks in a
grade book or on report cards, then the child will never know the
sea as her father knows it, unless this knowledge comes to her from
sources outside the school. Instead of becoming a living thing and
the source of life, her sea will be a desert without oasis, or
grass, or tree, or bird, or bubbling spring to refresh and inspire.
It would seem a sad commentary upon our teaching if the child is
compelled to gain a right conception of the sea outside
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name=
"page104"></a>104</span>the school and in spite of the school,
rather than through and by means of the school.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The quest of teacher and
child.</span>&mdash;The vitalized teacher knows the sea as the sage
knows it, and can infuse her conception into the consciousness of
the child. She feels it to be her high privilege to lead the child
on in quest of the sea and to find, in this quest, pulsating life.
In this alluring quest, she is putting content into the word, and
thus discovering, by experience, what life is. This is education.
This is the inviting vista that stretches out before the eyes of
the child under the spell and leadership of such a teacher. In
their quest for the meaning of the sea, these companions, the child
and the teacher, will come upon the fields of grain, the orchards,
the flocks and herds, the ships, the trains, and the whole
intricate world of commerce. They will find commerce to be a
manifestation of the sea and moreover a big factor in life. It will
mean far more than mere cars to be counted or cargoes to be
estimated in the form of problems for the class in arithmetic. The
cargoes of grain that they see leaving the port mean food for the
hungry in other lands, and the joy and vigor that only food can
give.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The sea as life.</span>&mdash;At every
turn of their ramified <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name=
"page105"></a>105</span>journey, these learners find life and, best
of all, are having a rich experience in life, throughout the
journey. They are immersed in life and so are absorbing life all
the while. Wider and wider becomes their conception of life as
exemplified by the sea, and their capacity for life is ever
increasing. Day by day they ascend to higher levels and find their
horizon receding farther and farther. For them, life enlarges until
it embraces all lands, the arts, the sciences, the languages, and
all history. Whether they pursue the sea into the mountains; to the
steppes, plateaus, or pampas; to the palace or the hovel; to the
tropics or the poles,&mdash;they find it evermore representing
life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The word
&ldquo;automobile.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;It would seem to be quite
possible to construct a twelve-year course of study based upon this
sort of study of words and their content with special emphasis upon
the content. Since life is conterminous with the content of the
words that constitute one&rsquo;s vocabulary, it is evident that
the content of words becomes of major importance in the scheme of
education. To be able to spell the word &ldquo;automobile&rdquo;
will not carry a young man very far in his efforts to qualify as a
chauffeur, important though the spelling may be. As a mere
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name=
"page106"></a>106</span>beginning, the spelling is essential, but
it is not enough. Still the child thinks that his education, so far
as this word is concerned, is complete when he can spell it
correctly, and carry home a perfect grade. No one will employ the
young man as a driver until he has put content into the word, and
this requires time and hard work. He must know the mechanism of the
machine, in every detail, and the articulation of all its parts. He
must be able to locate trouble on the instant and be able to apply
the remedy. He must be sensitive to every slightest sound that
indicates imperfect functioning. This, of course, carries far
beyond the mere spelling of the word, but all this is essential to
the safety of his passengers.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Etymology.</span>&mdash;Etymology has its
place, of course, in the study of words, but it stops short of the
goal. It may be well to take the watch apart in order to make an
examination of its parts, but until it is reconstituted and set
going, it is useless as a watch. So with a word. We may give its
etymology and rhapsodize over its parts, but thus analyzed it is an
inert thing and really inane so far as real service is concerned.
If word study does not carry beyond the mere analysis, it is futile
as a real educative <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name=
"page107"></a>107</span>process. To be really effective, the word
must be instinct with life and busy in the affairs of life, and not
a mere specimen in a museum. Too often our work in etymology seems
to be considered an end in itself, rather than a means to an
end.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The word in use.</span>&mdash;Arlo Bates
says that the word &ldquo;highly&rdquo; in the Gettysburg Speech is
the most ornate word in the language in the setting that Lincoln
gave it. The merest tyro can give its etymology, but only when it
was set to work by a master did it gain potency and distinction.
The etymology of the word &ldquo;fidelity&rdquo; is reasonably
easy, but this analysis is powerless to cause the child to thrill
at the story of Casabianca, or of Ruth and Naomi, or of Esther, or
Antigone, or Cordelia, or Nathan Hale, or the little Japanese girl
who deliberately bit through her tongue that she might not utter a
syllable that would jeopardize the interests or safety of her
father. The word analyzed is a dead thing; the word in use is a
living thing. The word merely analyzed is apt to be ephemeral; the
word in use is abiding and increasingly significant. As the child
puts more and more content into the word, he, himself, expands at
the same rate in the scope and power of his thinking. Words are the
materials out of which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name=
"page108"></a>108</span>he weaves the fabric of life, and the
pattern depends upon the content of his words.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustrations from art.</span>&mdash;The
child can spell the word &ldquo;art&rdquo; and can repeat the words
of the book by way of a memorized definition, but he cannot define
the word with even a fair degree of intelligence. He cannot know
the meaning of the word until its significance becomes objectified
in his life processes. This requires time, and thought, and
experiences with books, with people, and with galleries. In short,
he must live art before he can define the word; and his living art
invests the word with content. The word will grow just as he grows
in his conception of art. At first, he may denominate as art the
simple little daubs of pictures that he makes with the
teacher&rsquo;s hand guiding his brush. But, later on, as he gains
a larger conception, these things will appear puerile if not silly.
The time may come when he can read the thoughts of the masters as
expressed in their masterpieces. Then, and only then, will he be
able to define the word.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Michael Angelo.</span>&mdash;At the age
of fifteen, Michael Angelo wrought the Mask of the Satyr, which
would not be considered a work of art if that were the only product
of his chisel. What he did later was the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>109</span>fulfillment
of the prophecy embodied in the Mask. At the age of eighty, he
produced the Descent from the Cross, which glorifies the Duomo in
Florence. In between these productions, we find his David, his
Moses, the Sistine Ceiling, with many others scarcely less notable.
He rose to a higher and higher conception of art as he lived art
more and more fully, and his execution kept pace with the expansion
of his conception. He gave content to the word both for himself and
for the world until now we associate, in our thinking, art with his
name. He himself is now, in large measure, our definition of
art&mdash;and that because he lived art.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s conception of
truth.</span>&mdash;In his restricted conception, the boy conceives
truth to be the mere absence of peccadillos. He thinks that his
denial of the charge that he was impolite to his sister, or that he
went on a foraging expedition to the pantry, is the whole truth
and, indeed, all there is to truth. It requires a whole lifetime to
realize the full magnitude of his misconception. In the vitalized
school, he finds himself busy all day long trying to find answer to
the question: What is Truth? In the Alps, there is a place called
Echo Glen where a thousand rocks, cliffs, and crags send
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name=
"page110"></a>110</span>back to the speaker the words he utters.
So, when this boy asks What is Truth? a thousand voices in the
school and outside the school repeat the question to him: What is
Truth? Abraham Lincoln tried to find the answer as he figured on
the bit of board with a piece of charcoal by the firelight. Later
on, he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, and in both exercises
he was seeking for the meaning of truth.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The work of the
school.</span>&mdash;Christopher Columbus was doing the same thing
in his quest, and thought no hardship too great if he could only
come upon the answer. Galileo, Huxley, Newton, Tyndall, Humboldt,
Darwin, Edison, and Burbank are only the schoolboys grown large in
their search for the meaning of truth. They have enlarged the
content of the word for us all, and by following their lead we may
attain to their answers. Every school study gives forth a partial
answer, and the sum of all these answers constitutes the answer
which the boy is seeking. Mathematics tells part of the story, but
not all of it; science tells another part, but not all of it;
history tells still another part, but not all of it. Hence, it may
be reiterated that one of the prime functions of the vitalized
school is to invest words with the largest possible content.</p>

<h3>COMPLETE LIVING</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The question raised.</span>&mdash;That
education is a preparation for complete living has been quoted by
every teacher who lays any sort of claim to the standard
definitions. Indeed, so often and so glibly has the quotation been
made that it is well-nigh axiomatic and altogether trite. But we
still await any clear explanation of what is meant by complete
living. On this point we are still groping, with no prophetic voice
to tell us the way. By implication we have had hints, and much has
been said on the negative side, but the positive side still lies
fallow. When asked for an explanation, those who give the quotation
resort to circumlocution and, at length, give another definition of
education, apparently conscious of the mathematical dictum that
things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. So
we continue to travel in a circle, with but feeble attempts to
deviate from the course.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name=
"page113"></a>113</span><span class="paraHead">The vitalized school
an exemplification.</span>&mdash;Nor will this chapter attempt to
resolve the difficult situation in which we are placed. It is not
easy to define living, much less complete living. All that is hoped
for here is to bring the matter to the attention of all teachers
and to cause them to realize that the quest for a definition of
complete living will be for them and for their pupils an
exhilarating experience. The vitalized school will belie its name
if it does not strive toward a solution of the difficulty, and any
school that approximates a satisfactory definition will be
proclaimed a public benefactor. In fact, the school cannot lay
claim to the distinction of being vitalized if it fails to
exemplify complete living, in some appreciable degree, and if it
fails to groove this sort of living into a habit that will persist
throughout the years. This is the big task that the school must
essay if it would emancipate itself from the trammels of tradition
and become a leader in the larger, better way. Complete living must
become the ideal of the school if it would realize the conception
of education of which it is a professed exponent.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Incomplete living.</span>&mdash;The man
who walks with a crutch; the man who is afflicted with a felon; the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name=
"page114"></a>114</span>man who lacks a hand or even a
finger,&mdash;cannot experience complete living. Through the power
of adaptation the man with a crutch may compass more difficult
situations than the man with sound legs will attempt, but he cannot
realize all the possibilities of life that a sound body would
vouchsafe to him. The man without hands may learn to write with his
toes, but he is not employed as a teacher of penmanship. His life
is a restricted one and, therefore, less than complete. We marvel
at the exhibitions of skill displayed by the maimed, but we feel no
envy. We may not be able to duplicate their achievements, but we
feel that we have ample compensation in the normal use of our
members. We know instinctively that, in the solitude of their
meditations, they must experience poignant regrets that they are
not as other people, and that they must pass through life under a
handicap.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The sound body.</span>&mdash;It is
evident, therefore, that soundness of body is a condition precedent
to complete living. The body is the organism by means of which the
mind and the spirit function in terms of life; and, if this
organism is imperfect, the functioning will prove less than
complete. Hence, it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name=
"page115"></a>115</span>is the province of the school to so
organize all its activities that the physical powers of the pupils
shall be fully conserved. The president of a large university says
that during his incumbency of seventeen years they have found only
one young woman of physical perfection and not a single young man,
although the tests have been applied to thousands. College
students, it will be readily conceded, are a selected group; and
yet even in such a group not a physically perfect young man was
found in tests extending over seventeen years. If a like condition
should be discovered in the scoring of live stock at our fairs,
there would ensue a careful investigation of causes in the hope of
finding a remedy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Personal efficiency.</span>&mdash;We
shall not achieve national efficiency until every citizen has
achieved personal efficiency, and physical fitness is one of the
fundamental conditions precedent to personal efficiency. Here we
have the blue print for the guidance of society and the school. If
we are ever to achieve national efficiency, we must see to it that
every man and woman, every boy and girl, has a strong, healthy body
that is fully able to execute the behests of mind and spirit. This
may <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name=
"page116"></a>116</span>require a stricter censorship of marriage
licenses, including physical examinations; it may require more
stringent laws on our statute books; it may require radical changes
in our methods of physical training; and it may require the state
to assume some of the functions of the home when the home reveals
its inability or unwillingness to cope with the situation. Heroic
treatment may be necessary; but until we as a people have the
courage to apply the remedies that the diagnosis shows to be
necessary, we shall look in vain for improvement.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Physical training.</span>&mdash;Seeing
that it is so difficult to find a man or a woman among our people
who has attained physical perfection, it behooves society and the
schools to take a critical inventory of their methods of physical
training and their meager accomplishments as a preliminary survey
looking to a change in our procedure. We seem to have delegated
scientific physical training to athletics and pugilism, with but
scant concern for our people as a whole. If pink-tea calisthenics
as practiced mildly in our schools has failed to produce robust
bodies, then it is incumbent upon us to adopt a r&eacute;gime of
beefsteak. What the traditional school has failed to do the
vitalized school must attempt <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"
name="page117"></a>117</span>to do or suffer the humiliation of
striking its colors. There is no middle course; it must either win
a victory or admit defeat in common with the traditional school.
The standard is high, of course, but every standard of the
vitalized school is and ought to be high.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Cigarettes.</span>&mdash;If the use of
cigarettes is devitalizing our boys, and this can be determined,
then the manufacture and sale must be prohibited unless our
legislative bodies would plead guilty to the charge of impotence.
But we are told that public sentiment conditions the enactment of
laws. If such be the case, then the school and its auxiliaries
should feel it a duty to generate public sentiment. If cigarettes
are harmful, then they should be banished, and the task is not an
impossible one by any means. As to the injurious effects of
cigarettes, as distinguished an authority as Thomas A. Edison says
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The injurious agent in cigarettes comes principally from
the burning paper wrapper. The substance thereby formed is called
&lsquo;acrolein.&rsquo; It has a violent action on the nerve
centers, producing degeneration of the cells of the brain, which is
quite rapid among boys. Unlike most narcotics, this degeneration is
permanent and uncontrollable. I employ no person who smokes
cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name=
"page118"></a>118</span>We have eliminated dangerous explosives
from our Fourth of July celebrations, and the ban can as easily be
placed upon any other dangerous product. Just here we inevitably
meet the cry of paternalism, but we shall always be confronted by
the question to what extent the government should stand aside and
see its citizens follow the bent of their appetites and passions
over the brink of destruction. It is the inherent right of
government to maintain its own integrity, and this it can do only
through the conservation of the powers of its citizens. If
paternalism is necessary to this end, then paternalism is a
governmental virtue. Better, by far, some paternalism than a race
of weaklings.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Military training.</span>&mdash;We may
shrink away from military training in the schools, just as we
shrink from the r&eacute;gime of pugilism; but we may profit by
observing both these types of training in our efforts to develop
some method of training that will render our young people
physically fit. We need some type of training that will eliminate
round and drooping shoulders, weak chests, shambling gait, sluggish
circulation, and shallow breathing. The boys and girls need to be,
first of all, healthy animals with large powers of endurance,
elastic, buoyant, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name=
"page119"></a>119</span>graceful, and in general well set up. These
conditions constitute the foundation for the superstructure of
education. The placid, an&aelig;mic, fiberless child is ill
prepared in physique to attain to that mastery of the mental and
spiritual world that makes for an approximation to complete
living.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Examples cited.</span>&mdash;If one will
but make a mental appraisement of the first one hundred people he
meets, he will see among the number quite a few who reveal a lack
of physical vigor. They droop and slouch along and seem to be
dragging their bodies instead of being propelled through space by
their bodies. They can neither stand nor walk as a human being
ought to stand and walk, and their entire ensemble is altogether
unbeautiful. We feel instinctively that, being fashioned in the
image of their Maker, they have sadly declined from their high
estate. Their bodily attitude seems a sort of apology for life, and
we long to invoke the aid of some teacher of physical training to
rescue them from themselves and restore them to their rightful
heritage. They are weak, apparently ill-nourished, scrawny,
ill-groomed; and we know, without the aid of words, that neither a
vigorous mind nor a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name=
"page120"></a>120</span>great spirit would choose that type of body
as its habitation.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The body subject to the
mind.</span>&mdash;A healthy, vigorous, symmetrical body that
performs all its functions like a well-articulated, well-adjusted
mechanism is the beginning, but only a beginning. Next comes a mind
that is so well trained that it knows what orders to give to the
body and how to give them. Many a strong body enters the door of a
saloon because the mind is not sufficiently trained to issue wise
orders. The mind was befuddled before the body became so, and the
body becomes so only because the mind commands. Intoxication,
primarily, is a mental apostasy, and the body cannot do otherwise
than obey. If the mind were intent upon securing a book at the
library, the body would not have seen the door of the saloon, but
would have been urgent to reach the library. There is neither
fiction nor facetiousness in the adage, &ldquo;An idle brain is the
devil&rsquo;s workshop.&rdquo; On the contrary, the saying is
crammed full of psychology for the thoughtful observer. Hence, when
we are training the mind we are wreaking destruction upon this
workshop.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Freedom a condition
precedent.</span>&mdash;Complete living <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>121</span>is
impossible outside the domain of freedom. The prisons show forth no
examples of complete living. But mental thralldom is quite as
inimical to complete living as thralldom of the body. The mind must
know in order to move among the things of life in freedom.
Ignorance is slavery. The mind that is unable to read the
inscription on a monument stands baffled and helpless, and no form
of slavery can be more abject. The man who cannot read the bill of
fare of life is in no position to revel in the good things that
life offers. The man who cannot read the signboards of life gropes
and flounders about in the byways and so misses the charms. If he
knows the way, he has freedom; otherwise he is in thralldom. The
man who cannot interpret life as it shows itself in hill, in
valley, in stream and rock and tree, goes through life with
bandaged eyes, and that condition affords no freedom.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Street signs.</span>&mdash;A man who had
been traveling through Europe for several weeks, and had finally
reached London, wrote enthusiastically of his pleasure at being
able to read the street signs. All summer he had felt restricted
and hampered, but when he reached a country where the street signs
were intelligible, he gained his freedom. Had he <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>122</span>been as
familiar with Italian, German, and French as he is with English,
life would have been for him far more nearly complete during that
summer and therefore much more agreeable and fertile. There is no
more exhilarating experience than to be able to read the street
signs along the highway of life, and this ability is one of the
great objectives of every vitalized school.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Trained minds.</span>&mdash;Nature
reveals her inmost secrets only to the trained mind. No power can
force her, no wealth can bribe her, to disclose these secrets to
others. Only the mind that is trained can gain admission to her
treasure house to revel in its glories. John Burroughs lives in a
world that the ignorant man cannot know. The trained mind alone has
the key that will unlock libraries, art galleries, the treasure
houses of science, language, history, and art. The untrained minds
must stand outside and win what comfort they can from their wealth,
their social status, or whatever else they would fain substitute
for the training that would admit them. All these things are parts
of life, and those who cannot gain admission to these
conservatories of knowledge cannot know life in its
completeness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name=
"page123"></a>123</span><span class="paraHead">Achievements of
trained minds.</span>&mdash;In order to know life in the large, the
mind must be able to leap from the multiplication table to the
stars; must become intimate with the movements of the tides, the
glacier, and the planets; must translate the bubbling fountain and
the eruption of Vesuvius; must be able to interpret the whisper of
the zephyr and the diapason of the forest; must be able to hear
music in the chirp of the cricket as well as in the oratorios; must
be able to delve into the recesses of the mine and scale the
mountain tops; must know the heart throbs of Little Nell as well as
of Cicero and Demosthenes; must be able to see the processions of
history from the cradle of the race to the latest proclamation; and
must sit in the councils of the poets, the statesmen, the orators,
the artists, the scientists, and the historians of all time. A mind
thus trained can enter into the very heart of life and know it by
experience.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Things of the spirit.</span>&mdash;But
education is a spiritual process, as we have been told; and,
therefore, education is without value unless it touches the spirit.
Indeed, it is only by the spirit that we may test the quality of
education. It is spirit that sets metes and bounds and points the
way to the fine <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name=
"page124"></a>124</span>things of life. A man may live in the back
alley of life or on the boulevard, according to the dictates of the
spirit. If his spirit cannot react to the finer things, his way
will lie among the coarse and bizarre. If he cannot appreciate the
glory that is revealed upon the mountain, he will gravitate to the
lower levels. If his spirit is not attuned to majestic harmonies,
he will drift down to association with his own kind. If he cannot
thrill with pleasure at the beauty and fragrance of the lily of the
valley, he will seek out the gaudy sunflower. If his spirit cannot
rise to the plane of Shakespeare and Victor Hugo, he will roam into
fields that are less fruitful. The spirit that is rightly attuned
lifts him away from the sordid into the realms of the chaste and
the glorified; away from the coarse and ugly into the realm of
things that are fine and beautiful; and away from the things that
are mean and petty into the zone of the big, the true, the noble,
and the good. And so with body, mind, and spirit thus doing their
perfect work, he can, at least, look over into the promised land of
complete living.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Altruism.</span>&mdash;We are commanded
to let our light shine, and this command is a noble and an
inspiring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name=
"page125"></a>125</span>one. A man who by such training as has been
depicted approximates complete living is prepared to let his light
shine primarily because he has light, and in the next place because
his training has made him generous in spirit and altruistic; and
his greatest joy comes from letting his light so shine that others
may catch his spirit and move up to higher planes of living.</p>

<h3>THE TIME ELEMENT</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The question stated.</span>&mdash;There
are many, doubtless, who will deny, if not actually resent, the
statement that some do more real teaching in ten minutes than
others do in thirty minutes. But, in spite of denials, the
statement can be verified by the testimony of a host of expert
observers and supervisors. Indeed, stenographic reports have been
made of many class exercises by way of testing the truth of this
statement, and these reports are a matter of record. Assuming the
validity of the statement, therefore, it is pertinent to inquire
into the causes that underlie the disparity in the teaching ability
of the ten-minute teacher and the thirty-minute teacher. The
efficiency expert would be quick to seize upon this disparity in
the rate of progress as the starting point in his critical
examination. In a factory a like disparity would lead to unpleasant
consequences. The workman who consumes thirty minutes in
accomplishing a piece of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128"
name="page128"></a>128</span>work that another does in ten minutes
would be admonished to accelerate his progress or else give way to
a more efficient man. If we had instruments of sufficient delicacy
to test the results of teaching, we should probably discover that
the output of the ten-minute teacher is superior in quality to that
of the thirty-minute teacher. For we must all have observed in our
own experience that the clarity of our thinking depends upon its
intensity.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Examples.</span>&mdash;A young man who
won distinction as a college student had a wide shelf fitted up on
one side of his room at which he stood in the preparation of all
his lessons. His theory was that the attitude of the body
conditions the attitude of the mind. Professor James gives assent
to this theory and avers that an attitude of mind may be generated
by placing the body in such an attitude as would naturally
accompany this mental attitude. This theory proclaims that, if the
body is slouching, the mind will slouch; but that, if the body is
alert, the mind will be equally so. Another college student always
walked to and fro in his room when preparing his history lesson. A
fine old lady, in a work of fiction, explained her mental acumen by
the single statement, &ldquo;I never slouch.&rdquo; Every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name=
"page129"></a>129</span>person must have observed many
exemplifications of this theory in his own experience even if he
has not reduced it to a working formula.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Basic considerations.</span>&mdash;Any
consideration of the time element, in school work, must take into
account, therefore, not only the number of minutes involved in a
given piece of work, but also the intensity of effort during those
minutes. Two minds, of equal natural strength, may be fully
employed during a given period and yet show a wide difference in
the quality and quantity of the results. The one may be busy all
the while but slouch through the minutes. The other may be taut and
intensive, working at white heat, and the output will be more
extensive and of better quality. The mind that ambles through the
period shows forth results that are both meager and mediocre; but
the mind whose impact is both forceful and incisive produces
results that serve to magnify the work of the school. Thus we have
placed before us two basic considerations, one of which is the time
itself, in actual minutes, and the other is the character of the
reactions to external stimuli during those minutes.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Two teachers compared.</span>&mdash;In
order to consider <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name=
"page130"></a>130</span>these factors of the teaching process with
some degree of definiteness it will be well to have the ten-minute
teacher and the thirty-minute teacher placed in juxtaposition in
our thinking. We shall thus be able to compare and contrast and so
arrive at some clear judgments that may be used as a basis for
generalizations. We may assume, for convenience and for
concreteness, that the lesson is division of fractions. There will
be substantial agreement that the principle involved in this
subject can be taught in one recitation period. The reasons for
some of the steps in the process may come later, but the child
should be able to find his way to the correct answer in a single
period. Now if one teacher can achieve this result in thirty
minutes and the other in ten minutes, there is a disparity in the
effectiveness of the work of these teachers which is worthy of
serious consideration. The ten-minute teacher proves that the
thirty-minute teacher has consumed twenty minutes of
somebody&rsquo;s time unnecessarily. If the salary of this
thirty-minute teacher should be reduced to one third its present
amount, she would inveigh against the reduction.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">School and factory
compared.</span>&mdash;If she were one <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page131" name="page131"></a>131</span>of the operators in a
factory, she would not escape with the mere penalization of a
salary reduction. The owner would argue that he needed some one who
could operate the machine up to its full capacity, and that, even
if she should work without salary, her presence in the factory
would entail a loss in that the output of her machine was so
meager. If one operator can produce a shoe in ten minutes and the
other requires thirty minutes for the same work, the money that is
invested in the one machine pays dividends, while the other machine
imposes a continuous tax upon the owner. This, of course, will be
recognized as the line of argument of the efficiency expert, but it
certainly is not out of place to call attention to the matter in
connection with school work. The subject of efficiency is quite
within the province of the school, and it would seem to be wholly
within reason for the school to exemplify its own teachings.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Appraisal of teaching
expertness.</span>&mdash;The teacher who requires thirty minutes
for division of fractions which the other teacher compasses in ten
minutes consumes twenty minutes unnecessarily in each recitation
period, or two hundred minutes in the course of the day. The
efficiency expert would ask <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"
name="page132"></a>132</span>her to account for these two hundred
minutes. In order to account for them satisfactorily she would be
compelled to take an inventory of her acquired habits, her
predilections, her attitude toward her pupils and her subjects, and
any shortcomings she may have in regard to methods of teaching. She
would, at first, resent the implication that the other
teacher&rsquo;s method of teaching division of fractions is better
than her own and would cite the many years during which her method
has been used. When all else fails, tradition always proves a
convenient refuge. We can always prove to-day by yesterday; only,
by so doing, we deny the possibility of progress.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The potency of right
methods.</span>&mdash;A teacher of Latin once used twenty minutes
in a violent attempt to explain the difference between the gerund
construction and the gerundive construction. At the end of the time
she had the pupils so completely muddled that, for months, the
appearance of either of these constructions threw them into a
condition of panic. To another class, later, this teacher explained
these constructions clearly and convincingly in three minutes. In
the meantime she had studied methods in connection with subject
matter. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name=
"page133"></a>133</span>Another teacher resigned her position and
explained her action by confessing that she had become so
accustomed to the traditional methods of teaching a certain phase
of arithmetic that it was impossible for her to learn the newer
one. Such a teacher must be given credit for honesty even while she
illustrates tragedy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The waste of time.</span>&mdash;In
explaining the loss of two hundred minutes a day the teacher will
inevitably come upon the subject of methods of teaching, and she
may be put to it to justify her method in view of its results. The
more diligently she tries to justify her method, the more certainly
she proclaims her responsibility for a wrong use of the method.
Those twenty minutes point at her the accusing finger, and she can
neither blink nor escape the facts. The other teacher led her
pupils into a knowledge of the subject in ten minutes, and this one
may neither abrogate nor amend the record. As an operative in the
factory she holds in her hand one shoe as the result of her thirty
minutes while the other holds three. Conceding that results in the
school are not so tangible as the results in the factory, still we
have developed methods of estimating results in the school that
have convincing weight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name=
"page134"></a>134</span>with the efficiency expert. We can estimate
results in school work with sufficient accuracy to enable us to
assess teaching values with a goodly degree of discrimination.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Possibilities.</span>&mdash;It would be a
comparatively simple matter to compute in days and weeks the time
lost during the year by the thirty-minute teacher, and then
estimate the many things that the pupils could accomplish in that
time. If the thirty-minute teacher could be transformed into a
ten-minute teacher, the children could have three more hours each
day for play, and that would be far better for them than the ordeal
of sitting there in the class, the unwilling witnesses, or victims,
of the time-wasting process. Or they might read a book in the two
hundred minutes and that would be more enjoyable, and the number of
books thus read in the course of a year would aggregate quite a
library. Or, again, they might take some additional studies and so
make great gains in mental achievements in their twelve years of
school life. Or they might learn to work with their hands and so
achieve self-reliance, self-support, and self-respect.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Conservation.</span>&mdash;In a word,
there is no higher type of conservation than the conservation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name=
"page135"></a>135</span>childhood, in terms of time and interest.
The two hundred minutes a day are a vital factor in the life of the
child and must be regarded as highly valuable. The teacher,
therefore, who subtracts this time from the child&rsquo;s life is
assuming a responsibility not to be lightly esteemed. She takes
from him his most valuable possession and one which she can never
return, try as she may. Worst of all, she purloins this element of
time clandestinely, albeit seductively, in the guise of friendship.
The child does not know that he is the victim of unfair treatment
until it is too late to set up any defense. He is made to think
that that is the natural and, therefore, only way of school, and
that he must take things as they come if he is to prove himself a
good soldier. So he musters what heroism he can and tries to smile
while the teacher despoils him of the minutes he might better be
employing in play, in reading, or in work.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s
complacency.</span>&mdash;This would seem a severe indictment if it
were incapable of proof, but having been proved by incontrovertible
evidence its severity cannot be mitigated. We can only grieve that
the facts are as they are and ardently hope for a speedy change.
The chief obstacle in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name=
"page136"></a>136</span>the way of improvement is the complacency
of the teacher. Habits tend to persist, and if she has contracted
the habit of much speaking, she thinks her volubility should be
accounted a virtue and wonders that the children do not applaud the
bromidic platitudes which have been uttered in the same form and in
the same tones a hundred times. She is so intoxicated with her own
verbosity that she can neither listen to the sounds of her own
voice nor analyze her own utterances. While her neighbor is
teaching she is talking, and then with sublime nonchalance she
ascribes the retardation of her pupils to their own dullness and
never, in any least degree, to her own unprofitable use of their
time.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The voluble teacher.</span>&mdash;And
while she rambles on in her aimless talking the children are bored,
inexpressibly bored. It is axiomatic that the learning process does
not flourish in a state of boredom. Under the ordeal of verbal
inundation the children wriggle and squirm about in their seats and
this affords her a new point of attack. She calls them ill-bred and
unmannerly and wonders at the homes that can produce such children.
She does not realize that if these children were grown-ups they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name=
"page137"></a>137</span>would leave the room regardless of
consequences. When they yawn, she reminds them of the utter
futility of casting pearls before swine. All the while the twenty
minutes are going and the pupils have not yet learned how to divide
fractions. Over in the next room the pupils know full well how to
divide fractions and the teacher is rewarding their diligence with
a cookie in the form of a story, while they wait for the bell to
ring. Out of the room of the thirty-minute teacher come the
children glowering and resentful; out of the other room the
children come buoyant and happy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The test of teaching.</span>&mdash;Not
alone did the former teacher use the time of her pupils for her own
ends, but, even more, she dulled their interest, and the damage
thus inflicted cannot be estimated. Many a child has deserted the
school because the teacher made school life disagreeable. She was
the wet blanket upon his enthusiasm and chilled him to the marrow
when he failed to go forward upon her traditional track. The
teacher who can generate in the minds of her pupils a spiritual
ignition by her every movement and word will not be humiliated by
desertions. Indeed, the test of the teacher is the mental attitude
of her pupils. The child who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"
name="page138"></a>138</span>drags and drawls through the lesson
convicts the teacher of a want of expertness. On the other hand,
when the pupils are all wide-awake, alert, animated, eager to
respond, and dynamic, we know that the teacher has brought this
condition to pass and that she is a ten-minute teacher.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Meaningless formalities.</span>&mdash;One
of the influences that tends to deaden the interest of children is
the ponderous formality that sometimes obtains. The teacher
solemnly calls the roll, although she can see at a glance that
there are no absentees. This is exceedingly irksome to wide-awake
boys and girls who are avid for variety. The same monotonous
calling of the roll day after day with no semblance of variation
induces in them a sort of mental dyspepsia for which they seek an
antidote in what the teacher denominates disorder. This so-called
disorder betokens good health on their part and is a revelation of
the fact that they have a keen appreciation of the fitness of
things. They cannot brook monotony and it irks them to dawdle about
in the anteroom of action. They are eager to do their work if only
the teacher will get right at it. But they are impatient of
meaningless preliminaries. They see no sense in calling the roll
when everybody <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name=
"page139"></a>139</span>is present and discredit the teacher who
persists in the practice.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Repeating answers.</span>&mdash;Still
another characteristic of the thirty-minute teacher is her habit of
repeating the answers that pupils give, with the addition of some
inane comment. Whether this repeating of answers is merely a bad
habit or an effort on the part of the teacher to appropriate to
herself the credit that should otherwise accrue to the pupils, it
is not easy to say. Certain it is that school inspectors inveigh
against the practice mightily as militating against the
effectiveness of the teaching. Teachers who have been challenged on
this point make a weak confession that they repeat the answers
unconsciously. They thus make the fatal admission that for a part
of the time of the class exercise they do not know what they are
doing, and admitting so much we can readily classify them as
belonging among the thirty-minute teachers.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Meanderings.</span>&mdash;Another
characteristic is her tendency to wander away from the direct line
and ramble about among irrelevant and inconsequential trifles.
Sometimes these rambles are altogether entertaining and enable her
pupils to pass the time pleasantly, but they lack &ldquo;terminal
facilities.&rdquo; They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name=
"page140"></a>140</span>lead from nowhere to nowhere in the most
fascinating and fruitless meanderings. Such expeditions bring back
no emoluments. They leave a pleasant taste in the mouth but afford
no nourishment. They use the time but exact no dividends. Like
sheet lightning they are beautiful but never strike anything. They
are soothing sedatives that never impel to action. They lull to
repose but never vitalize.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The ten-minute teacher.</span>&mdash;It
is evident, therefore, that only the ten-minute teacher is worthy
of a place in the vitalized school. She alone is able and willing
to conserve, with religious zeal, the time and interest of the
pupils. To her their time and interest are sacred and she deems it
a sacrilege to trifle with them. She knows the market value of her
own time but does not know the value of the time of the possible
Edison who sits in her class. She gives to every child the benefit
of the doubt and respects both herself and her pupils too much to
take chances by pitting herself against them and using their time
for her own purposes. Moreover, she never permits their interest to
flag, but knows how to keep their minds tense. Their reactions are
never less than incisive, and, therefore, the truths of the lesson
groove themselves deep in their consciousness.</p>

<h3>THE ARTIST TEACHER</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Teaching as a fine
art.</span>&mdash;Teaching is an art. This fact has universal
recognition. But it may be made a fine art, a fact that is not so
generally recognized. The difference between the traditional school
and the vitalized school lies in the fact, to a large degree, that,
in the former, teaching is regarded merely as an art, while in the
latter it becomes a fine art. In the former, the teacher is an
artisan; in the latter the teacher is an artist. The difference is
broadly significant. The artisan, in his work, follows directions,
plans, specifications, and blue-prints that have been devised and
designed by others; the artist imbues his work with imagination.
The artisan works by the day&mdash;so much money for so many
hours&rsquo; work with pay day as his large objective; the artist
does not disdain pay day, but he has an objective beyond this and
has other sources of pleasure besides the pay envelope. The artisan
thinks and talks of pay day; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144"
name="page144"></a>144</span>the artist thinks and talks of his
work. The artisan drops his work when the bell rings; the artist is
so engrossed in his work that he does not hear the bell. The
artisan plods at his task with a grudging mien; the artist works in
a fine frenzy.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Characteristic qualities.</span>&mdash;It
is not easy to find the exact words by which to differentiate the
traditional teacher from the artist teacher. There is an elusive
quality in the artist teacher which is not easily reduced to or
described by formal words. We know that the one is an artist
teacher and that the other is not. The formal examination may not
be able to discover the artist teacher, but there is a sort of
knowledge that transcends the findings of an examination, that
makes her identity known. She is a real flesh and blood person and
yet she has a distinctive quality that cannot be mistaken even
though it eludes description. She exhales a certain exquisiteness
that reveals itself in the delicacy and daintiness of her contact
with people and the objective world. Her impact upon the
consciousness is no more violent than the fragrance of the rose,
but, all at once, she is there and there to stay, modest, serene,
and masterful.</p>
<p>She is as gentle as the dawn but as staunch as <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>145</span>the oak. She
has knowledge and wisdom, and, better still, she has understanding;
she needs no diagram. Her gaze penetrates the very heart of a
situation but is never less than kindly, and her eyes are never
shifty. Her aplomb, her pose, and her poise belong to her quite as
evidently as her hands. She is genuine and altogether free from
affectation. Her presence stimulates without intoxicating, and she
accepts the respect of people with the same naturalness and grace
as would accompany her acceptance of a glass of water. Both the
giver and the recipient of this respect are ennobled by the giving.
Indeed she would far rather have the respect of people, her pupils
included, than mere admiration, for she knows full well that
respect is far more deeply rooted in the spirit and bears fruit
that is more worth while. Her nature knows not inertia, but it
abounds in enterprise, endeavor, and courage that are born of a
high purpose.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Joy in her work.</span>&mdash;Her
teaching and her life do not occupy separate compartments but are
identical in time and space; only her teaching is but one phase or
manifestation of her life. She fitly exemplifies the statement that
&ldquo;Art is the expression of man&rsquo;s joy in his work.&rdquo;
She has great joy in her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"
name="page146"></a>146</span>work and, therefore, it is done as any
other artist does his work. She enjoys all life, including her
work. Indeed, she has contracted the habit of happiness and is so
engrossed in the big elemental things of life that she can laugh at
the incidental pin-pricks that others call troubles. She
differentiates major from minor and never permits a minor to usurp
the throne. Being an integral part of her life, her work takes on
all the hues of her life. For her, culture is not something added;
rather it is a something that permeates her whole nature and her
whole life. She does not read poetry and other forms of literature,
study the great masterpieces of music and art, and seek communion
with the great, either in person or through their works&mdash;she
does not do these things that she may acquire culture, but does
them because she has culture.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Dynamic qualities.</span>&mdash;Her
character is the sum of all her habits of thinking, feeling, and
action and, therefore, is herself. Since she is an artist, her
habits are all pitched in a high key and she is culture
personified. Her immaculateness of body and spirit is not a
superficial acquisition but a fundamental expression of her real
self. Just as the electric bulb diffuses light, so she diffuses an
atmosphere <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name=
"page147"></a>147</span>of culture. She gives the artistic touch to
every detail of her work because she is an artist, a genuine,
sincere artist in all that makes up life. She has the heart of an
artist, the eyes of an artist, the touch of an artist. Whether
these qualities are inherent or acquired is beside the point, at
present, but it may be remarked, in passing, that unless they were
capable of cultivation, the world would be at a standstill. There
is no place in her exuberant vitality for a jaundiced view, and
hence her world does not become &ldquo;stale, flat, and
unprofitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Aspiration and
worship.</span>&mdash;Every sincere, noble aspiration is a prayer;
hence, she prays without ceasing in obedience to the admonition of
the Apostle. And, let it be said in reverence, she helps to answer
her own prayers. Her spirit yearns out toward higher and wider
attainments every hour of the day, not morbidly but exultantly. And
while she aspires she worships. The starry sky holds her in rapt
attention and admiration, and the modest flower does no less. She
is thankful for the rain, and revels in the beauty and abundance of
the snow. The heat may enervate, but she is grateful, none the
less, because of its beneficent influence upon the farmer&rsquo;s
work. Like food and sleep, her attitude <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>148</span>of worship
conserves her powers and preserves her balance. When physical
weariness comes, she sends her spirit out to the star, or the sea,
or the mountain, and so forgets her burden in the contemplation of
majesty and beauty. In short, her spirit is attuned to all beauty
and sublimity and truth, and so she is inherently an artist.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Professor Phelps quoted.</span>&mdash;In
his very delightful book, &ldquo;Teaching in School and
College,&rdquo; the author, Professor William Lyon Phelps, says:
&ldquo;I do not know that I could make entirely clear to an
outsider the pleasure I have in teaching. I had rather earn my
living by teaching than in any other way. In my mind, teaching is
not merely a life work, a profession, an occupation, a struggle; it
is a passion. I love to teach. I love to teach as a painter loves
to paint, as a musician loves to play, as a singer loves to sing,
as a strong man rejoices to run a race. Teaching is an art&mdash;an
art so great and so difficult to master that a man or a woman can
spend a long life at it, without realizing much more than his
limitations and mistakes, and his distance from the ideal. But the
main aim of my happy days has been to become a good teacher, just
as every architect wishes to be a good architect, and every
professional <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name=
"page149"></a>149</span>poet strives toward perfection. For the
chief difference between the ambition of the artist and the
ambition of a money-maker&mdash;both natural and honorable
ambitions&mdash;is that the money-maker is after the practical
reward of his toil, while the artist wants the inner satisfaction
that accompanies mastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Attitude toward work.</span>&mdash;To
these sentiments the artist teacher subscribes whole-heartedly, if
not in words, certainly by her attitude and practices. She regards
her work not as a task but as a privilege, and thinking it a
privilege she appreciates it as she would any other privilege. She
would esteem it a privilege to attend a concert by high-class
artists, or to visit an art gallery, or to witness a presentation
of a great drama, or to see the Jungfrau; and she feels the same
exaltation as she anticipates her work as a teacher. She sings on
her way to school because of the privileges that await her. She
experiences a fine flow of sentiment without becoming sentimental.
Teaching, to her, is a serious business, but not, in the least,
somber. Painting is a serious business, but the artist&rsquo;s zeal
and joy in his work give wings to the hours. Laying the Atlantic
cable was a serious business, but the vision <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>150</span>of success
was both inspiring and inspiriting, and temporary mishaps only
served to stimulate to greater effort.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The element of
enthusiasm.</span>&mdash;To this teacher, each class exercise is an
enterprise that is big with possibilities; and, in preparation for
the event, she feels something of the thrill that must have
animated Columbus as he faced the sea. She estimates results more
by the faces of her pupils than by the marks in a grade book, for
the field of her endeavors is the spirit of the child, and the face
of the child telegraphs to her the awakening of the spirit. Like
the sculptor, she is striving to bring the angel of her dream into
the face of the child; and when this hope is realized, the
privilege of being a teacher seems the very acme of human
aspirations. The animated face and the flashing eye betoken the
sort of life that her teaching aims to stimulate; and when she sees
these unmistakable manifestations, she knows that her big
enterprise is a success and rejoices accordingly. If, for any
reason, her enthusiasm is running low, she takes herself in hand
and soon generates the enthusiasm that she knows is indispensable
to the success of her enterprise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name=
"page151"></a>151</span><span class="paraHead">Redemption of common
from commonplace.</span>&mdash;She has the supreme gift of being
able to redeem the common from the plane of the commonplace.
Indeed, she never permits any fact of the books to become
commonplace to her pupils. They all know that Columbus discovered
America in 1492, but when the recitation touches this fact she
invests it with life and meaning and so makes it glow as a factor
in the class exercise. The humdrum traditional teacher asks the
question; and when the pupil drones forth the answer,
&ldquo;Columbus discovered America in 1492,&rdquo; she dismisses
the whole matter with the phonographic response, &ldquo;Very
good.&rdquo; What a farce! What a travesty upon the work of the
teacher! Instead of being very good, it is bad, yea, inexpressibly
bad. The artist teacher does it far better. By the magic of her
touch she causes the imagination of her pupils to be fired and
their interest to thrill with the mighty significance of the great
event. They feel, vicariously, the poverty of Columbus in his
appeals for aid and wish they might have been there to assist. They
find themselves standing beside the intrepid mariner, watching the
angry waves striving to beat him back. They watch him peering into
space, day after day, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name=
"page152"></a>152</span>and feel a thousand pities for him in his
suspense. And when he steps out upon the new land, they want to
shout out their salvos and proclaim him a victor.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The voyage of Columbus.</span>&mdash;They
have yearned, and striven, and prayed with Columbus, and so have
lived all the events of his great achievements. Hence, it can never
be commonplace in their thinking. The teacher lifted it far away
from that plane and made it loom high and large in their
consciousness. A dramatic critic avers that the action of the play
occurs, not upon the stage, but in the imagination of the auditors;
that the players merely cause the imagination to produce the
action; and that if nothing were occurring in the imagination of
the people in the seats beyond what is occurring on the stage, the
audience would leave the theater by way of protest. The artist
teacher acts upon this very principle in every class exercise.
Neither the teacher nor the book can possibly depict even a moiety
of all that she hopes to produce in the imagination of the pupils.
She is ever striving to find the one word or sentence that will
evoke a whole train of events in their minds. Just here is where
her superb art is shown. A whole volume could <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>153</span>not portray
all that the imagination of the pupils saw in connection with the
voyage of Columbus, and yet the teacher caused all these things to
happen by the use of comparatively few words. This is high art;
this proclaims the artist teacher.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Resourcefulness.</span>&mdash;In her work
there is a fineness and a delicacy of touch that baffles a
satisfactory analysis. She has the power to call forth Columbus
from the past to re&euml;nact his great discovery in the
imagination of her pupils&mdash;all without noise, or bombast, or
gesticulation. She does what she does because she is what she is;
and she needs neither copyright nor patent for protection. Her work
is suffused with a rare sort of enthusiasm that carries conviction
by reason of its genuineness. This enthusiasm gives to her work a
tone and a flavor that can neither be disguised nor counterfeited.
Her work is distinctive, but not sensational or pyrotechnic. Least
of all is it ever hackneyed. So resourceful is she in devising new
plans and new ways of saying and doing things that her pupils are
always animated by a wholesome expectancy. She is the dynamo, but
the light and heat that she generates manifest themselves in the
minds of her pupils, while she remains serene and quiet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name=
"page154"></a>154</span><span class="paraHead">The thirteen
colonies.</span>&mdash;With the poet Keats she can sing:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all</p>
<p>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Animated by this sentiment, she disdains no form of truth,
whether large or small, for in every form of truth she finds
beauty; and her spirit reacts to it on the instant, and joy is the
resultant. This is the basis for her superb enthusiasm in every
detail of her work as well as the source of her joyous living. Her
pupils may name the thirteen original colonies without a slip, but
that is not enough for her. The establishing of these colonies
formed a mighty epoch in history, and she must dwell upon the
events until they throb through the life currents of her pupils.
Names in books must mean people with all their hopes, their
aspirations, their trials and hardships, their sorrows and their
joys. The conditions of life, the food, the clothing, the houses,
the modes of travel, and the dangers must all come into the mental
picture. Hence it is that she prepares for the lesson on the
colonies as she would make ready for a trip with the pupils around
the world, and the mere giving of names is negligible in her
inspiring enterprise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name=
"page155"></a>155</span><span class="paraHead">Every subject
invested with life.</span>&mdash;She finds in the circulation of
the blood a subject of great import and makes ready for the lesson
with enthusiastic anticipation. Her step is elastic as she takes
her way to school on this particular day, and her face is beaming,
for to-day comes to the children this stupendous revelation. She
feels as did the college professor when he was just ready to begin
an experiment in his laboratory and said to his students,
&ldquo;Gentlemen, please remove your hats; I am about to ask God a
question.&rdquo; She approaches every truth reverently, albeit
joyously, for she feels that she is the leader of the children over
into the Promised Land. In the book already quoted, Professor
Phelps says, &ldquo;I read in a German play that the mathematician
is like a man who lives in a glass room at the top of a mountain
covered with eternal snow&mdash;he sees eternity and infinity all
about him, but not much humanity.&rdquo; Not so in her teaching of
mathematics; for every subject and every problem transports her to
the Isle of Patmos, and the hour is crowded with revelations.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Human interest.</span>&mdash;And wherever
she is, there is humanity. There are no dry bones in her work, for
she invests every subject with human interest <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>156</span>and causes
it to pulsate in the consciousness of her pupils. If there are dry
bones when she arrives, she has but to touch them with the magic of
her humanity, and they become things of life. Whether long division
or calculus, it is to her a part of the living, palpitating truth
of the world, and she causes it to live before the minds of the
pupils. The so-called dead languages spring to life in her
presence, and, like Aaron&rsquo;s rod, blossom and bring forth at
her touch. Wherever she walks there are resurrections because life
begets life. No science, no mathematics, no history, no language,
can be dull or dry when touched by her art, but all become vital
because she is vital. By the subtle alchemy of her artistic
teaching all the subjects of her school are transmuted into the
pure gold of truth and beauty.</p>

<h3>THE TEACHER AS AN IDEAL</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Responsibility of the
exemplar.</span>&mdash;If the teacher could be convinced that each
of her pupils is to become a replica of herself, she would more
fully appreciate the responsibilities of her position. At first
flush, she might feel flattered; but when she came into a full
realization of the magnitude of the responsibility, she would
probably seek release. If she could know that each pupil is
striving to copy her in every detail of her life, her habits of
speech, her bodily movements, her tone of voice, her dress, her
walk, and even her manner of thinking, this knowledge would appall
her, and she would shrink from the responsibility of becoming the
exemplar of the child. She cannot know, however, to what extent and
in what respects the pupils imitate her. Nor, perhaps, could they
themselves give definite information on these points, if they were
put to the test. Children imitate their elders both consciously and
unconsciously; so, whether the teacher wills <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>160</span>it so or
not, she must assume the functions of an exemplar as well as a
teacher.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Absorbing standards.</span>&mdash;If we
give full credence to Tennyson&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I am a
part of all that I have met,&rdquo; then it follows that we have
become what we are, in some appreciable measure, through the
process of absorption. In other words, we are a composite of all
our ideals. The vase of flowers, daintily arranged, on the
breakfast table becomes the standard of good taste thenceforth, and
all through life a vase of flowers arranged less than artistically
gives one a sensation of discomfort. A traveler relates that in a
hotel in Brussels he saw window curtains of a delicate pattern;
and, since that time, he has sought in many cities for curtains
that will fill the measure of the ideal he absorbed in that hotel.
Beauty is not in the thing itself, but in the eye of the beholder,
and the eye is but the interpreter of the ideal. One person
rhapsodizes over a picture that another turns away from, because
the latter has absorbed an ideal that is unknown to the former.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Education by
absorption.</span>&mdash;This subject of absorption has not
received the careful attention that its importance warrants. In the
social consciousness education has been so long associated with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name=
"page161"></a>161</span>books, and formal processes, that we find
it difficult to conceive of education outside of or beyond books.
If, as we so confidently assert, education is a spiritual process,
then whatever stimulates the spirit must be education, whether a
landscape, a flower, a picture, or a person. The traveler who sits
enrapt before the Jungfrau for an hour or a day is becoming more
highly educated, even in the absence of books and formalities. The
beauty of the mountain touches his spirit, and there is a
consequent reaction that fulfills all the claims of the educational
processes. In short, he is lifted to a higher plane of
appreciation, and that is what the books and the schools are
striving to achieve.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The principle
illustrated.</span>&mdash;In the presence of this mountain the
tourist gains an ideal of grandeur which becomes his standard of
estimating scenery throughout life. A boy once heard &ldquo;The
Dead March&rdquo; played by an artist, and when he was grown to
manhood that was still his ideal of majestic music. A traveler
asserts that no man can stand for an hour on the summit of Mt. Rigi
and not become a better and a stronger man for the experience. A
writer on art says that it is worth a trip across the ocean to see
the painting of the bull by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162"
name="page162"></a>162</span>Paul Potter; but that, of course,
depends upon the ideals of the beholder. All these illustrations
conform to and are in harmony with the psychological dictum that in
the educational process the spirit reacts to its environment.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher as
environment.</span>&mdash;But the environment may include people as
well as inanimate objects, mountains, rivers, flowers, and
pictures. And, as a part of the child&rsquo;s environment, the
teacher takes her place in the process of education by absorption.
A city superintendent avers that there is one teacher in his corps
who would be worth more to his school than the salary she receives
even if she did no teaching. This means that her presence in the
school is a wholesome influence, and that she is the sort of
environment to which the pupils react to their own advantage. It
might not be a simple thing to convince some taxpayers of the truth
of the superintendent&rsquo;s statement, but this fact only proves
that they have not yet come into a realization of the fact that
there can be education by absorption.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The Great Stone Face.</span>&mdash;The
people of Florence maintain that they need not travel abroad to see
the world, for the reason that the world comes to <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>163</span>them. It is
true that many thousands visit that city annually to win a
definition of art. There they absorb their ideals of art and thus
attain abiding standards. In like manner the child may sojourn in
the school to gain an ideal of grace of manner and personal charm
as exemplified by the teacher, and no one will have the temerity to
assert that this phase of the child&rsquo;s education is less
important than those that are acquired through the formal
processes. The boy in the story grew into the likeness of the
&ldquo;Great Stone Face&rdquo; because that had become his ideal,
and not because he had had formal instruction in the subject of
stone faces, or had taken measurements of or computed the
dimensions of the one stone face. He grew into its likeness because
he thought of it, dreamed of it, absorbed it, and was absorbed by
it, and reacted to it whenever it came into view.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Pedagogy in
literature.</span>&mdash;Hawthorne, in this story, must have been
trying to teach the lesson of unconscious education or education by
absorption, but his readers have not all been quick to catch his
meaning. Teachers often take great unction in the reflection that
they afford to the child his only means of education, and that but
for them the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name=
"page164"></a>164</span>child would never become educated at all.
We are slow to admit that there are many sources of education
besides the school, and that formal instruction is not the only
road to the acquisition of knowledge. Tennyson knew and expressed
this conception in the quotation already given, but we have not
acquired the habit of consulting the poets and novelists for our
pedagogy. When we learn to consult these, we shall find them
expressing many tenets of pedagogy that are basic.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The testimony of
experience.</span>&mdash;But we need not go beyond our own
experiences to realize that much of our education has been
unconsciously gained, that we have absorbed much of it, and,
possibly, what we now regard as the most vital part of it. We have
but to explore our own experiences to discover some person whose
standards have been effective in luring us out of ourselves and
causing us to yearn toward higher levels; who has been the beacon
light toward which our feet have been stumbling; who has been the
pattern by which we have sought to shape our lives; and for whom we
feel a sense of gratitude that cannot be quenched. The influence of
that person has been a liberal education in the vital things that
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name=
"page165"></a>165</span>books do not teach, and we shudder to think
what we might have been had that influence not come into our lives.
This ideal is not some mythical, far-away person, but a real man or
woman who has challenged our admiration by looks, by conduct, by
position, and by general bearing in society.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The one teacher.</span>&mdash;This
preliminary part of the subject has been dwelt upon thus at length
in an effort to win assent to the general proposition that
unconscious education is not only possible, but an actuality. This
assent being once given, the mind feels out at once for
applications of the principle and, inevitably, brings the parent
and the teacher into the field of view. But the parent is too near
to us in time, in space, and in relation to afford the illustration
that we seek, and we pass on to the teacher. In the experience of
each one of us there stands out at least one teacher as clear in
definition as a cameo. This teacher may not have been the most
scholarly, or the most successful in popular esteem, or even the
most handsome, but she had some quality that differentiates her in
our thinking from all others. Others may seem but a sort of blur in
our memory, but not so this one. She alone is distinct,
distinctive, and regnant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name=
"page166"></a>166</span><span class="paraHead">Her
supremacy.</span>&mdash;The vicissitudes of life have not availed
to dethrone her, nor have the losses, perplexities, and sorrows of
life caused the light of her influence to grow dim. She is still an
abiding presence with us, nor can we conceive of any influence that
could possibly obliterate her. She may have been idealized by
degrees, but when she came fully into our lives she came to stay.
She came not as a transient guest, but as a lifelong friend and
comrade. She crept into our lives as gently as the dawn comes over
the hills, and since her arrival there has been no sunset. Nor was
there ever by pupil or teacher any profession or protestation, but
we simply accepted each other with a frankness that would have been
weakened by words.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The r&ocirc;le of ideal.</span>&mdash;But
the r&ocirc;le of ideal is not an easy one. It is a comparatively
simple matter to give instruction in geography, arithmetic, and
history, but to know one&rsquo;s self to be the ideal of a child,
or to conceive of the possibility of such a situation and relation,
is sufficient to render the teacher deeply thoughtful. Once it is
borne in upon her that the child will grow into her likeness, she
cannot dismiss the matter from her thinking as she can the lesson
in grammar. The child may <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167"
name="page167"></a>167</span>be unconscious of the matter, but the
teacher is acutely conscious. When she stands before her class she
sees the child growing into her image, and this reflection gives
cause and occasion for a careful and critical introspection. She
feels constrained to take an inventory of herself to determine
whether she can stand a test that is so searching and so
far-reaching.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s other
self.</span>&mdash;As she stands thus in contemplation she sees the
child grown to maturity with all her own
predilections&mdash;physical, mental, spiritual&mdash;woven into
the pattern of its life. In this child grown up she sees her other
self and can thus estimate the qualities of body, mind, and spirit
that now constitute herself, as they reveal themselves in another.
She thus gains the child&rsquo;s point of view and so is able to
see herself through the child&rsquo;s eyes. When she is reading a
book, she is aware that the child is looking over her shoulder to
note the quality of literature that engages her interest. When she
is making a purchase at the shop, she finds the child standing at
her elbow and duplicating her order. When she is buying a picture,
she is careful to see to it that there are two copies, knowing that
a second copy must be provided <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page168" name="page168"></a>168</span>for the child. When she is
arranging her personal adornment, she is conscious of the child
peeping through the door and absorbing her with languishing
eyes.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The status
irrevocable.</span>&mdash;Wherever she goes or whatever she does,
she knows that the child is walking in her footsteps and
re&euml;nacting her conduct. Her status is irrevocably fixed in the
life of the child, nor can any philosophy or sophistry absolve her
from the situation. She cannot abdicate her place in favor of
another, nor can she win immunity from responsibility. She is the
child&rsquo;s ideal for weal or woe, nor can men or angels change
this big fact. Through all the hours of the day she hears the child
saying, &ldquo;Whither thou goest I will go,&rdquo; and there is no
escape.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s
viewpoint.</span>&mdash;This is no flight of fancy. Rather it is a
reality in countless schoolrooms of the land if only the teachers
were alive to the fact. But we have been so busy measuring,
estimating, scoring, and surveying the child for our purposes that
we have given but scant consideration to the child&rsquo;s point of
view as regards the teacher. We have not been quick to note the
significant fact that the child is estimating, measuring, scoring,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name=
"page169"></a>169</span>surveying the teacher for purposes of its
own and in the strictest obedience to the laws of its nature.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s need of
ideals.</span>&mdash;Every child needs and has a right to ideals,
and finds the teacher convenient both in space and in the nature of
her work to act in this capacity. Because of the character of her
work and her peculiar relation to the child, the teacher assumes a
place of leadership, and the child naturally appropriates her as
the lodestar for which his nature is seeking. And so, whether the
teacher leads into the morass or into the jungle, the child will
follow; but if she elects to take her way up to the heights, there
will be the child as faithful as her shadow. If the teacher plucks
flowers by the way, then, in time, gathering flowers will become
habitual to the child, nor will there be any need to admonish the
child to gather flowers. The teacher plucks flowers, and that
becomes the child&rsquo;s command. Education by absorption needs
neither admonition nor homilies.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The ideal a perpetual
influence.</span>&mdash;And all this is life&mdash;actual life,
fundamental life, and inevitable life. Moreover, the inevitableness
of this phase of life serves to accentuate its importance. The
idealized teacher gives to the child his ideals of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>170</span>conduct,
literature, art, music, home, school, and service. Take this
teacher out of his life and these ideals vanish. Better by far
eliminate the formal instruction, important as that may be made to
be, than to rob the child of his ideals. They are the influences
that are ever active even when formal instruction is quiescent.
They are potent throughout the day and throughout the year. They
induce reactions and motor activities that groove into habits, and
they are the external stimuli to which the spirit responds.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s
attitude.</span>&mdash;The vitalized school takes full cognizance
of this phase and means of education and gives large scope and
freedom for its exercise and development. The teacher is more
concerned with who and what her pupils are to be twenty years hence
than she is in getting them promoted to the next grade. She knows
full well that vision clarifies sight, and she is eager to enlarge
their vision in order to make their sight more keen and clear. She,
therefore, adopts as her own standards of life and conduct what she
wishes for her pupils when they have come to maturity. She may not
proclaim herself an ideal teacher or a model teacher, but she is
cognizant of the fact that she <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page171" name="page171"></a>171</span>is the model and the ideal
of one or more pupils in her school and bases her rule of life upon
this fact.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Prophetic conduct.</span>&mdash;In her
dress she decides between ornateness and simplicity as a
determining factor in the lives of her pupils both for the present
and for the years to come. In this she feels that she is but doing
her part in helping to determine the trend and quality of
civilization. She is reading such books as she hopes to find in
their libraries when they have come to administer homes of their
own. She is directing her thinking into such channels as will bear
the thoughts of her pupils out into the open sea of bigness and
sublimity. Knowing that pettiness will be inimical to society in
the next generation, she is careful to banish it from her own
life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Her rule of life.</span>&mdash;In her
thinking she comes into intimate relations with the sea and all its
ramified influences upon life. She invites the mountains to take
her into their confidence and reveal to her the mysteries of their
origin, and their influence upon the winds, the seasons, the
products of the earth, and upon life itself. She communes with the
great of all times that she may learn of their <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>172</span>concepts as
to the immensities which the mind can explore, as well as intricate
and infinite manifestations of the human soul. She associates with
the planets and rides the spaces in their company. She asks the
flowers, the sunrise glow of the morning, the hues of the rainbow,
and the drop of dew to explain to her what God is, and rejoices in
their responses.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Her growth.</span>&mdash;And so, through
her thinking she grows big&mdash;big in her aspirations, big in her
sympathies with all nature and mankind, big in her altruism, and
big in her conceptions of the universe and all that it embraces.
And when people come to know her they almost lose sight of the
teacher in their contemplation of the woman. Her pupils, by their
close contact and communion, became inoculated with the germs of
her bigness and so follow the lead of her thinking, her
aspirations, her sympathies, and her conceptions of life. Thus they
grow into her likeness by absorbing her thoughts, her ideals, her
standards, in short, herself.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Seeing life large.</span>&mdash;The
bigness of her spirit and her ability to see and feel life in the
large superinduce dignity, poise, and serenity. She never flutters;
but, calm and masterful, she moves on her majestic way with regal
mien. Nor is her teaching <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173"
name="page173"></a>173</span>less thorough or less effective
because she has a vision. On the contrary, she teaches cube root
with accuracy and still is able to see and to cause her pupils to
see the index finger pointing out and up toward the mathematical
infinities. She can give the latitude and longitude of Rome, and,
while doing so, review the achievements of that historic city. She
can explain the action of the geyser and still find time and
inclination to take delight in its wonders. She can analyze the
flower and still revel in its beauty. She can teach the details of
history and find in them the footprints of great historical
movements. All these things her pupils sense and so invest her with
the attributes of an ideal.</p>

XV</h2>
<h3>THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The term defined.</span>&mdash;The
socialized recitation, as its name implies, is a recitation in
which teacher and pupils form themselves into a committee of the
whole for the purpose of investigating some phase of a school
study. In this committee the line of cleavage between teacher and
pupils is obliterated as nearly as possible, the teacher exercising
only so much of authority as will preserve the integrity of the
group and forestall its disintegration. The teacher thus becomes a
co&ouml;rdinate and co&ouml;perating member of the group, and her
superior knowledge of the subject is held in abeyance to be called
into requisition only in an emergency and as a last resort. It will
readily be seen, however, that the teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of the
subject must be far more comprehensive in such a procedure than in
the question-and-answer type of recitation, for the very cogent
reason that the discussion is both liable and likely to diverge
widely from the limits of the book; and <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>177</span>the teacher
must be conversant, therefore, with all the auxiliary facts. She
must be able to cite authorities in case of need, and make specific
data readily accessible to all members of the group. This
presupposes wide reading on her part, and a consequent familiarity
with all the sources of knowledge that have a bearing upon the
subject under consideration.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The pupil-teacher.</span>&mdash;In order
to make the co&ouml;perative principle of the recitation active in
practice a pupil acts as chairman of the meeting, serving in
rotation, and gives direction to the discussion. He is clothed with
authority, also, to restrict the discussion to time limits that
there may be no semblance of monopoly and that the same rights and
privileges may be accorded to each member of the class. The
chairman, in short, acts both as captain and as umpire, with the
teacher in the background as the court of final appeal. Knowing the
order of rotation, each pupil knows in advance upon what day he is
to assume the functions of chairman and makes preparation
accordingly, that he may acquit himself with credit in measuring up
to the added responsibilities which the position imposes. In taking
the chair he does not affect an air of superiority for the reason
that he knows the position to have <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page178" name="page178"></a>178</span>come to him by rotation and
that upon his conduct of the duties depend his chances for honor;
and acting for his peers he is careful not to do anything that will
lead to a forfeiture of their respect and good will.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Some advantages.</span>&mdash;It requires
far more time to describe these preliminary arrangements than it
does to put them into operation. Indeed, after the first day, they
become well-nigh automatic. Because of their adaptableness the
pupils look upon the new order as the established order, and,
besides, the rotation in the chair affords a pleasing antidote to
monotony. Each day brings just enough novelty to generate a
wholesome degree of anticipation. They are all stimulated by an
eagerness to know just what the day will bring forth. The class
exercise is relieved of much of the heavy formalism that
characterizes the traditional recitation and that is so irksome to
children of school age. The socialized recitation is a worthy
enterprise that enlists the interest of all members of the group
and unifies them upon the plane of a common purpose. In the common
quest they become members in a social compact whose object is the
investigation of some subject that has been found worthy the
attention and thoughtful consideration of scholars and authors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name=
"page179"></a>179</span><span class="paraHead">The gang
element.</span>&mdash;The members of the group represent all strata
of society, and the group is, in consequence, a working democracy.
Moving in the same direction under a common impulse and intent upon
a laudable enterprise, race and class distinctions are considered
negligible, if, indeed, they are not entirely overlooked or
forgotten. The group is, in truth, a sublimated gang with the
undesirable elements eliminated and the potential qualities of the
gang retained. The gang spirit when impelling in right directions
and toward worthy ends is to be highly commended. In the gang, each
member stimulates and re&euml;nforces the other members, and their
achievements in combination amply justify their co&ouml;peration.
The potency of the gang spirit is well exemplified in such
enterprises as &ldquo;tag day&rdquo; for the benefit of charity,
the sale of Red Cross stamps, and the sale of special editions of
papers. People willingly enlist in these enterprises who would not
do so but for the element of co&ouml;peration. We have come to
recognize and write upon the psychology of the gang, and the
socialized recitation strives to utilize these psychological
principles for the advancement and advantage of the enterprise in
hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name=
"page180"></a>180</span><span class="paraHead">Proprietary
interest.</span>&mdash;In a co&ouml;perative enterprise such as the
one under consideration each member of the group feels a sense of
responsibility for the success of the enterprise as a whole, and
this makes for increased effort. In the traditional recitation the
pupil feels responsibility only for that part of the lesson upon
which he is called to recite. In his thinking the enterprise
belongs to the teacher, and therefore he feels no proprietary
interest. If the lesson is a failure, he experiences no special
compunction; if a success, he feels no special elation. If the
trunk with which he struggles up the stairs is his own, he has the
feeling of a victor when he reaches the top; but since it belongs
to the teacher, he feels that he has finished a disagreeable task,
takes his compensating pittance in the form of a grade, and goes on
his complacent way. The boy who digs potatoes from his own garden
thinks them larger and smoother than the ones he digs for wages.
The latter are potatoes, while the former are his potatoes.
Proprietary interest sinks its roots deep into the motives that
impel to action.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">This interest in
practice.</span>&mdash;The recitation in question strives to
generate a proprietary interest in the enterprise on the part of
every member of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name=
"page181"></a>181</span>the class so that each one may have a share
in the joy of success. Such an interest gives direction and
efficacy to the work of the class exercise. Given such an interest,
the pupil will not sit inert through the period unless stimulated
by a question from the teacher, but will ask intelligent and
pertinent questions to help the enterprise along. Moreover, each
pupil, because of his proprietary interest in the enterprise, will
feel constrained to bring to class such subsidiary aids as his home
affords. His interest causes him to react to clippings, pictures,
magazine articles, books, and conversations that have a bearing
upon the topic, and these he contributes opportunely in his zeal
for the success of the recitation. His pockets become productive of
a varied assortment of materials that the tentacles of his interest
have seized upon in his preparation for the event, and so all
members of the class become beneficiaries of his explorations and
discoveries.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The potency of ownership.</span>&mdash;A
child is interested in his own things. The little girl fondles her
doll in the most tender way, even though it does not measure up to
the accepted standards of excellence or elegance. But it is her
doll; hence her affection. Volumes have been written upon the
general subject <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name=
"page182"></a>182</span>of interest, and we have been admonished to
attach our teaching to the native interests of the child, but the
fundamental interest of proprietorship has strangely enough been
overlooked. If we want to discover and localize the child&rsquo;s
interest, we have but to make an inventory of his possessions. His
pony, his dog, or his cart will discover to us one of his
interests. Again, if we would generate an interest in the child, we
have but to make him conscious that he is the owner of the thing
for which we hope to awaken his interest. This is fundamental in
this type of recitation. The teacher effaces herself as much as
possible in order to develop in the pupils a feeling of
proprietorship in the exercise in progress, and the pupils are
quick to take the advantage thus afforded to make the work their
own.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Exemplified in society.</span>&mdash;The
socialized recitation has its counterpart in many a group in
society. In the blacksmith shop, at the grocery, in the barber
shop, in the office, at the club, and in the field, we find groups
of people in earnest, animated conversation or discussion. They are
discussing politics, religion, community affairs, public
improvements, tariff, war, fashions, crops, live stock, or
machinery. Whatever the topic, they pursue the give-and-take
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name=
"page183"></a>183</span>policy in their efforts to arrive at the
truth. They contest every point and make concessions only when they
are confronted by indisputable facts. Some feeling, or even
acrimony, may be generated in the course of the discussion, but
this is always accounted a weakness and a substitute for valid
argument. The recitation is rather more decorous than some of these
other discussions, but, in principle, they are identical. Every one
has freedom to express his convictions and to adduce contributory
arguments or evidence. There are no restrictions save the implied
one of decorum. The utmost courtesy obtains in the recitation, even
at the sacrifice of some eagerness. There may be a half-dozen
members of the group on their feet and anxious to be heard, but
they do not interrupt one another without due apology.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Abiding resultants.</span>&mdash;Unlike
some of their elders, they are ready to acknowledge mistakes and to
make concessions. They do not scruple to correct the mistakes of
others, knowing that corrections will be gratefully received, but
they do not accept mere statements from one another. They must have
evidence. They combat statements with evidence from books or other
sources that are regarded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184"
name="page184"></a>184</span>as authorities. They read extracts, or
draw diagrams, or display pictures or specimens in support of their
contentions. There is animation, to be sure; and, at times, the
flushed face and the flashing eye betoken intense feeling. But the
psychologist knows full well that these expressions intensify and
make abiding the impressions. Both in victory and in defeat the
pupil comes to an appreciation of the truth. Defeat may humiliate,
but he will evermore know the rock on which his craft was wrecked.
Victory may elate and exalt, but he will not forget the occasion or
the facts. The truths of the lesson become enmeshed in his nervous
system and throughout life they will be a part of himself.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Reflex influence.</span>&mdash;Still
further, this type of recitation reaches back into the home and
begets a wholesome co&ouml;peration between the home and the
school, and this is a desideratum of no slight import. The events
of the day are recounted at the home in the evening, and the
contributions of the members of the family are deposited as assets
in the recitation the next day. Then the family is eager to learn
of the reactions of the class to their contributions. Such a
community of interests cannot be confined to the four walls of a
home, but finds its way to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"
name="page185"></a>185</span>other homes and to places of business;
the discussions of the class become the property of society, and
the influence is most salutary. Indirectly, the school is affording
the people of the community many profitable topics of conversation,
and these readily supplant the futile and less profitable topics.
It is easy to measure the intelligence of an individual or of a
community by noting the topics of conversation. Gossip and small
talk do not thrive in a soil that has been thoroughly inoculated
with history, art, music, literature, economics, and
statecraft.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Influence upon pupils.</span>&mdash;From
the foregoing it will be seen that this type of recitation
represents, not a <i>modus operandi</i>, but, rather, a <i>modus
vivendi</i>, not a way of doing things, merely, but a manner of
living. The work of the school is redeemed from the plane of a task
and lifted to the plane of a privilege. The pupil&rsquo;s
initiative is given full recognition and inspiriting freedom
ensues. The teacher is not a taskmaster but a friend in need.
Pupils and teacher live and work together in an enterprise in which
they have common interests. The emoluments attending success are
shared equally and there is no place for envy in the distribution
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name=
"page186"></a>186</span>dividends. There is fair dealing in every
detail of the work, with no semblance of discrimination. There is a
cash basis in every transaction. If a pupil&rsquo;s offerings are
rejected, he sees at once that they are inferior to others and
becomes a willing shareholder in the ones that are superior to his
own. Nothing that is spurious or counterfeit can gain currency in
the enterprise, because of the critical inspection of the members
of the group, all of whom are jealous for the preservation of the
integrity of their organization.</p>
<p>In this cross section of life we find young people learning, by
the laboratory method, the real meaning of reciprocity; we find
them winning the viewpoints of others with no abatement or
abrogation of their own individuality; we find them able and
willing to make concessions for the general good; we find them
learning justice and discrimination in their assessment of values;
we find them enlarging their horizons by ascending to higher levels
of intelligence. This work is as much a part of life for them as
their food or their games and they accept it on the same terms.
They are becoming upright, intelligent, effective citizens by
performing some of the work that engages the time and energies of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name=
"page187"></a>187</span>such citizens. They are learning how to
live by the experience of actual living.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Part of an actual recitation
given.</span>&mdash;Some schools have developed this type of
recitation to a very complete degree and in a very effective way.
In one such school the young woman who teaches the subject of
history makes the following report of a part of one of her
recitations in this study:</p>
<p>The class was called to order by the chairman for the assignment
for the next day&rsquo;s lesson, which proceeded as follows:</p>
<p>Teacher:&mdash;To-morrow we shall have for the work of this
convention the New Constitution as a whole. We are ready for
suggestions as to how we had best proceed.</p>
<p>Earl:&mdash;It seems to me that a good way would be to compare
it with the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<p>Joe:&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite get your idea. Do you mean to
take them article by article?</p>
<p>Earl:&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>(Joe and Frank begin at the same time. Teacher indicates Joe by
nod.)</p>
<p>Joe:&mdash;But there are so many things in the new that are not
in the old.</p>
<p>Earl:&mdash;That is just it. Let&rsquo;s make a list of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name=
"page188"></a>188</span>points in one that do not appear in the
other. Then by investigation and discussion see if we can tell
why.</p>
<p>Teacher:&mdash;Frank, you had something to say a moment ago.</p>
<p>Frank:&mdash;Not on Earl&rsquo;s plan, which I think an
excellent one, but I wished to ask the class if they think it
important while looking through these two documents to keep in mind
the questions: &ldquo;Is this the way things are done
to-day?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Does this apply in our own city?&rdquo;
and &ldquo;In case the President or Congress failed in their duty,
what could the people do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella:&mdash;It seems to me that Frank&rsquo;s suggestion is a
good one for it bears upon what we decided in the beginning, that
we must apply the history of the past to see how it affects us
to-day.</p>
<p>Violet:&mdash;I should like to know how the people received the
work of this convention. You know that it was all so secret no one
knew what they were doing behind their closed doors. If the people
were like they are to-day there would certainly be some opposition
to the New Constitution.</p>
<p>Elsie:&mdash;Good. Mr. Chairman, I move that Violet report the
reception and rejection of the New Constitution <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>189</span>by the
people of the several States as a special topic for to-morrow.</p>
<p>Robert:&mdash;Second the motion.</p>
<p>Chairman:&mdash;Miss Brown, have you any suggestion as to time
limit?</p>
<p>Teacher:&mdash;I suggest ten minutes. (Chairman puts vote and
suggestion is carried.)</p>
<p>Teacher:&mdash;Mr. Chairman, may we have the secretary read the
several points in the assignment?</p>
<p>At the chairman&rsquo;s request the secretary reads and the
class note as follows: Study of the New Constitution, emphasizing
points of similarity and difference.</p>
<p>Seek reasons for same.</p>
<p>Application of Constitution to our present-day life.</p>
<p>Remedy for failures if officers fail to do their duty.</p>
<p>Special topic ten minutes in length on the reception of the
Constitution by the people of the different States.</p>
<p>Teacher:&mdash;I think that will be enough&mdash;consult the
text. In connection with the special topic some valuable material
may be found in the Civics section in the reference room. The other
references on this subject you had given you. Mr. Chairman, may we
have the secretary read the points brought out by yesterday&rsquo;s
recitation?</p>

<h3>AGRICULTURE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Agriculture a typical
study.</span>&mdash;In the vitalized school the subject of
agriculture is typical and may profitably be elaborated somewhat by
way of illustrating the relation of a subject to school procedure.
From whatever angle we approach the subject of agriculture we find
it inextricably connected with human life. This fact alone gives to
it the rank of first importance. Its present prominence as a school
study is conclusive evidence that those who are charged with the
responsibility of administering the schools are becoming conscious
of the need for vitalizing them. Time was when arithmetic was
regarded as the most practical subject in the school and,
therefore, it was given precedence over all others. History,
grammar, and geography were relegated to secondary rank, and
agriculture was not even thought of as a school study. But as
population increased and the problem of providing food began to
loom large in the public consciousness, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>193</span>the subject
of agriculture assumed an importance that rendered it worthy a
place in the school curriculum. It is a high tribute to the school
that whenever any subject takes hold of the public mind the school
is thought of at once as the best agency for promulgating that
subject. The subjects of temperance and military training aptly
illustrate this statement of fact.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Its rapid development.</span>&mdash;So
soon, therefore, as the subject of agriculture became prominent in
the public consciousness there ensued a speedy development of
colleges and schools of agriculture for the training of teachers.
This movement was prophetic of the plan and purpose to incorporate
this study in the school r&eacute;gime. And this prophecy has been
fulfilled, for the school now looks upon agriculture as a basic
study. True, we are as yet only feeling our way, and that for the
very good reason that the magnitude of the subject bewilders us. We
have written many textbooks on the subject that were soon
supplemented by better ones. The more the subject is studied, the
more we appreciate its far-reaching ramifications. We find it
attaching itself to many other subjects to which it seemed to have
but remote relation in the earlier stages of our study.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name=
"page194"></a>194</span>In brief, we are now on the borderland of a
realization of the fact that agriculture is as broad as life and,
therefore, must embrace many other studies that have a close
relation to life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Relation to geology and other
sciences.</span>&mdash;In the beginning, geology and agriculture
seemed far apart, but our closer study of agriculture has revealed
the fact that they are intimately related. It remained for
agriculture to lay the right emphasis upon geology. The study of
the composition and nature of the soil carried us at once to a
study of its origin and we found ourselves at the very door of
geology. When we began to inquire how the soil came to be where it
is and what it is, we found ourselves yearning for new and clearer
lines of demarcation in science, for we could scarcely distinguish
between geology and physiography. We soon traced our alluvial
plains back to their upland origin, and then we were compelled to
explain their migration. This led us inevitably into the realm of
meteorology, for, if we omit meteorology, the chain is broken and
we lose our way in our search for the explanation we need. But
having availed ourselves of the aid of meteorology, we have a story
that is full of marvelous interest&mdash;the great story of the
evolution <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name=
"page195"></a>195</span>of the cornfield. In this story we find
many alluring details of evaporation, air movements, precipitation,
erosion, and the attraction of gravitation. But in all this we are
but lingering in the anteroom of agriculture.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The importance of
botany.</span>&mdash;Advancing but a single step we find ourselves
in the realm of botany, which is a field so vast and so fascinating
that men have devoted an entire lifetime to its wonders, and then
realized that they had but made a beginning in the way of exploring
its possibilities. In our own time Mr. Burbank has made his name
known throughout the world by his work in one phase of this
subject, and a score of other Burbanks might be working with equal
success in other branches of the subject and still not trench upon
one another&rsquo;s domain. Venturesome, indeed, would be the
prophet who would attempt to predict the developments in the field
of botany in the next century in the way of providing food,
shelter, and clothing for the race. The possibilities stagger the
imagination and the prophet stands bewildered as he faces this
ever-widening field. But botany, vast as it is seen to be, is only
one of the branching sciences connected with agriculture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name=
"page196"></a>196</span><span class="paraHead">Physics and
chemistry.</span>&mdash;Another advance brings us into the wide and
fertile field of physics and chemistry, for in these subjects we
find the means of interpreting much in agriculture that without
their aid would elude our grasp. We have only to resolve a grain of
corn into its component elements to realize the potency and scope
of chemistry. Then if we inquire into the sources of these elements
as they have come from the soil to form this grain of corn, the
indispensability of a knowledge of chemistry will become more
apparent. In our explanations we shall soon come upon capillary
attraction, and the person is dull, indeed, who does not stand in
awe before the mystery of this subject. If we broaden our inquiry
so as to compass the evolution of an ear of corn, we shall realize
that we have entered upon an inquiry of vast and fascinating
import. The intricate and delicate processes of growth, combining,
as they do, the influences of sunshine and moisture and the
conversion into food products of elements whose origin goes back to
primeval times,&mdash;these processes are altogether worthy of the
combined enthusiasms of scientist and poet.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Physiology.</span>&mdash;But no mention
has been made, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name=
"page197"></a>197</span>as yet, of the science of physiology,
which, alone, requires volumes. We have but to ask how wheat is
converted into brain power to come upon a realization of the
magnitude of the study of this science. We have only to relax the
leash of fancy to see that there are no limits to the excursions
that may be made in this field. If we allow fancy to roam, taking
the <i>a posteriori</i> course, we might begin with &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; and reach its sources in garden and field, in orchard,
and in pasture where graze flocks and herds. But in any such
fanciful meandering we should be well within the limits of
physiology, and should be trying to interpret the adaptation of
means to end, or, to use the language of the present, we should be
making a quest to determine how the products of field, orchard, and
pasture may be utilized that they may function in poetry, in
oratory, in discoveries, and in inventions. In short, we should be
trying to explain to ourselves how agriculture functions in
life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Art as an auxiliary.</span>&mdash;In a
recent work of fiction a chapter opens with a picture of a little
girl eating a slice of bread and butter which is further surmounted
by apple sauce and sugar. If the author of the book
&ldquo;Agriculture and Life&rdquo; had only caught <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>198</span>a glimpse of
this picture, he might have changed the title of his book to
&ldquo;Life and Agriculture.&rdquo; He certainly would have given
to the life element far more prominence than his book in its
present form affords. His title makes a promise which the book
itself does not redeem, more&rsquo;s the pity. If science would use
art as an ally, it need not be less scientific, and its teachings
would prove far more palatable. The little girl with her bread and
butter would prove quite as apt as an introductory picture for a
book on agriculture as for a work of fiction. It matters not that
agriculture includes so many other sciences, for life is the great
objective of the study of all these, and the little girl
exemplifies life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Relation of sciences to
life.</span>&mdash;The pictures are practically endless with which
we might introduce the study of agriculture&mdash;a boy in the
turnip field, a milkmaid beside the cow, or Millet&rsquo;s
celebrated picture &ldquo;Feeding the Birds.&rdquo; And, sooner or
later, pursuing our journey from such a starting point, we shall
arrive at physiology, chemistry, botany, physics, meteorology, and
geology, and still never be detached from the subject of life. In
the school consciousness agriculture and domestic science seem far
apart, but by right teaching they are made to <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>199</span>merge in the
subject of life. Upon that plane we find them to be complementary
and reciprocal. In the same way chemistry, botany, and physiology
merge in agriculture for the reason that all these sciences as well
as agriculture have to do with life. In the traditional school
chemistry is taught as chemistry&mdash;as a branch of science, and
the learner is encouraged to seek for knowledge. In the vitalized
school the truths of chemistry are no less clearly revealed, but,
in addition, their relations to life are made manifest, and the
learner has a fuller appreciation of life, because of his study of
chemistry.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Traditional methods.</span>&mdash;In the
traditional school domestic science is taught that the girl may
learn how to cook; but in the vitalized school the girl learns how
to cook that she may be able to make life more agreeable and
productive both for herself and for others. In the traditional
school the study of agriculture consists of the testing of soils
and seeds, working out scientific theories on the subject of the
rotation of crops, testing for food values the various products of
the farm, judging stock, studying the best method of propagating
and caring for orchards, and testing for the most economic
processes for conserving and marketing crops. In <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>200</span>the
vitalized school all this is done, but this is not the ultimate
goal of the study. The end is not reached until all these
ramifications have touched life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child as the
objective.</span>&mdash;Reverting once more to the little girl of
the picture, it will be conceded, upon careful consideration, that
she is the center and focus of all the activities of mind and hand
pertaining to agriculture. Every furrow that is plowed is plowed
for her; every tree that is planted is planted for her; every crop
that is harvested is harvested for her; and every trainload of
grain is moving toward her as its destination. But for her, farm
machinery would be silent, orchards would decay, trains would cease
to move, and commerce would be no more. She it is that causes the
wheels to turn, the harvesters to go forth to the fields, the
experiment stations to be equipped and operated, the markets to
throb with activity, and the ships of commerce to ply the ocean.
For her the orchard, the granary, the dairy, and the loom give of
their stores, and a million willing hands till, and toil, and
spin.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The story of bread.</span>&mdash;But the
bread and butter, the apple sauce, and the sugar! They may not be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name=
"page201"></a>201</span>omitted from the picture. The bread
transports us to the fields of waving grain and conjures up in our
imagination visions of harvesters with their implements, wagons
groaning beneath their golden loads, riches of grain pouring forth
from machines, and brings to our nostrils the tang of the harvest
time. Into this slice of bread the sun has poured his wealth of
sunshine all the summer long, and into it the kindly clouds have
distilled their treasures. In it we find the glory of the sunrise,
the sparkling dewdrop, the song of the robin, the gentle mooing of
the cows, the murmur of the brook, and the creaking of the mill
wheel. In it we read the poetry of the morning and of the evening,
the prophecy of the noontide heat, and the mighty proclamations of
Nature. And it tells us charming stories of health, of rosy cheeks,
of laughing eyes, of happiness, of love and service.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Food and life.</span>&mdash;The butter,
the apple sauce, and the sugar each has a story of its own to tell
that renders fiction weak by comparison. If our hearts were but
attuned to the charm and romance of the stories they have to tell,
every breakfast-table would be redolent with the fragrance of
thanksgiving. If our hearts were responsive to the eloquence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name=
"page202"></a>202</span>of these stories, then eating would become
a ceremony and upon the farmer who provides our food would descend
our choicest benedictions. If the scales could but fall from our
eyes that we might behold the visions which our food foretells, we
could look down the vista of the years and see the children grown
to manhood and womanhood, happy and busy in their work of enlarging
and beautifying civilization.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Agriculture the source of
life.</span>&mdash;Agriculture is not the sordid thing that our
dull eyes and hearts would make it appear. In it we shall find the
romance of a Victor Hugo, the poetry of a Shelley or a Shakespeare,
the music of a Mozart, the eloquence of a Demosthenes, and the
painting of a Raphael, when we are able to interpret its real
relation to life. When the morning stars sang together they were
celebrating the birth of agriculture, but man became bewildered in
the mazes of commercialism and forgot the music of the stars. It is
the high mission of the vitalized school to lead us back from our
wanderings and to restore us to our rightful estate amid the
beauties, the inspiration, the poetry, and the far-reaching
prophecies of agriculture. This it can do only by revealing to us
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name=
"page203"></a>203</span>possibilities, the glories, and the joy of
life and causing us to know that agriculture is the source of
life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Synthetic teaching.</span>&mdash;The
analytic teaching of agriculture will not avail; we must have the
synthetic also. Too long have we stopped short with analysis. We
have come within sight of the promised land but have failed to go
up and possess it. We have studied the skeleton of agriculture but
have failed to endow it with life. We must keep before our eyes the
picture of the little girl. We must feel that the quintessence and
spirit of agriculture throbs through all the arteries of life. Here
lies the field in which imagination can do its perfect work. Here
is a subject in which the vitalized school may find its highest and
best justification. By no means is it the only study that fitly
exemplifies life, but, in this respect, it is typical, and
therefore a worthy study. On the side of analysis the teacher finds
the blade of grass to be a thing of life; on the side of synthesis
she finds the blade of grass to be a life-giving thing. And the
synthesis is no less in accord with science than the analysis.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The element of faith.</span>&mdash;Then
again agriculture and life meet and merge on the plane of faith.
The element of faith fertilizes life and causes it to <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>204</span>bring forth
in abundance. Man must have faith in himself, faith in the people
about him, and faith in his own plans and purposes to make his life
potent and pleasurable. By faith he attaches the truths of science
to his plans and thus to the processes of life; for without the
faith of man these truths of science are but static. Faith gives
them their working qualities. There is faith in the plowing of each
furrow, faith in the sowing of the seed, faith in the planting of
each tree, and faith in the purchase of each machine. The farmer
who builds a silo has faith that the products of the summer will
bring joy and health to the winter. By faith he transmutes the
mountains of toil into valleys of delight. Through the eyes of
faith he sees the work of his hands bringing in golden sheaves of
health and gladness to his own and other homes.</p>

<h3>THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">An analogy.</span>&mdash;If we may win a
concept of the analogy between the vitalized school and a
filtration-plant, we shall, perhaps, gain a clearer notion of the
purpose of the school and come upon a juster estimate of its
processes. The purpose of the filtration-plant is to purify,
clarify, and render more conducive to life the stream that passes
through, and the function of the school may be stated in the same
terms. The stream that enters the plant is murky and deeply
impregnated with impurities; the same stream when it issues from
the plant is clear, free from impurities, and, therefore, better in
respect to nutritive qualities. The stream of life that flows into
the school is composed of many heterogeneous elements; the stream
that issues from the school is far more homogeneous, clearer, more
nearly free from impurities, and, therefore, more conducive to the
life and health of the community. The stream of life that flows
into the school is composed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207"
name="page207"></a>207</span>of elements from all countries,
languages, and conditions. In this are Greeks and barbarians, Jews
and Gentiles, saints and sinners, the washed and the unwashed, the
ignorant, the high, the low, the depraved, the weak, and the
strong.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life-giving properties.</span>&mdash;The
stream that issues from the school is the very antithesis of all
this. Instead of all these heterogeneous elements, the stream when
it comes from the school is composed wholly of Americans. A hundred
flags may be seen in the stream that enters the school, but the
stream that flows out from the school bears only the American flag.
The school has often been called the melting-pot, in which the many
nationalities are fused; but it is far more than that. True,
somehow and somewhere in the school process these elements have
been made to coalesce, but that is not the only change that is
wrought. The volume of life that issues from the school is the same
as that which enters, barring the leakage, but the resultant stream
is far more potent in life-giving properties because of its passage
through the school.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Changes wrought.</span>&mdash;When we see
the stream entering the filtration-plant polluted with impurities
and then coming forth clear and wholesome, we <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>208</span>know that
something happened to that stream in transit. Similarly, when we
see the stream of life entering the school as a mere aggregation of
more or less discordant elements and then coming forth in a
virtually unified homogeny, we know that something has happened to
that stream in its progress through the school. To determine just
what happens in either case is a task for experts and a task,
moreover, that is well worth while. In either case we may well
inquire whether the things that happen are the very best things
that could possibly be made to happen; and, if not, what
improvements are possible and desirable.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Another misconception.</span>&mdash;The
analogy between the plant and the school will not hold if we still
retain in the parlance of school procedure the expression
&ldquo;getting an education.&rdquo; The act of getting implies
material substance. Education is not a substance but a process, and
it is palpably impossible to get a process. So there can be no such
thing as getting an education, in spite of the tenacity of the
expression. Even to state the fact would seem altogether trite,
were we not confronted every day with the fact that teachers and
parents are either unable or unwilling to substitute some right
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name=
"page209"></a>209</span>expression for this wrong one. Education is
not the process of getting but, rather, the process of becoming,
and the difference is as wide as the difference between the true
and the false.</p>
<p>Just how long it will require to eradicate this conception from
the school and society no one can well conjecture. Its presence in
our nomenclature reveals, in a marked way, the strength of habit.
Many teachers will give willing assent to the fact and then use the
expression again in their next sentence. Certainly we shall not
even apprehend the true function and procedure of the vitalized
school until we have eliminated this expression. If we admit the
validity of the contention as to this expression, then we may
profitably resume the consideration of our analogy, for, in that
case, we shall find in this analogy no ineptitude.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The validity of the
analogy.</span>&mdash;We cause the stream of water to pass through
the filtration-plant that it may become rectified; we cause the
stream of life to pass through the school that it may become
rectified. When the stream of water becomes rectified, bodily
disease is averted; when the stream of life is rectified, mental
and spiritual disease is averted. The analogy, therefore, holds
good whether we consider <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210"
name="page210"></a>210</span>the process itself or its effect. We
have only to state the case thus to have opened up for us a wide
field for profitable speculation. The diseases of mind and spirit
that invade society are the causes that lie back of our police
courts, our prisons, and, very often, our almshouses. Hence, if the
stream of life could be absolutely rectified, these undesirable
institutions would disappear, and life for the entire community
would be far more agreeable by reason of their absence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Function of the school.</span>&mdash;The
school, then, is established and administered to carry on this
process of rectification. By means of this process ignorance
becomes intelligence, coarseness becomes culture, strife becomes
peace, impurity becomes purity, disease becomes health, and
darkness becomes light. The child comes into the school not to get
something but to have something done to and for him that he may
become something that he was not before, and, therefore, that he
may the better execute his functions as a member of society. In
short, he comes into the school that he may pass through the
process of rectification. In this process he loses neither his
name, his extraction, his identity, nor his individuality. On the
contrary, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name=
"page211"></a>211</span>all these attributes are so acted upon by
the process that they become assets of the community.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Language.</span>&mdash;In order to lead
to a greater degree of clarity it may be well to be even more
specific in explaining this process of rectification. Language is
fundamental in all the operations of society. It is indispensable
to the grocer, the farmer, the lawyer, the physician, the
manufacturer, the housewife, and the legislator. It is the means by
which members of society communicate with one another, and without
communication, in some form, there can be no social intercourse,
and, therefore, no society. People are all interdependent, and
language is the bond of union. They must use the same language, of
course, and the words must be invested with the same meaning in
order to be intelligible.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Language a social
study.</span>&mdash;Just here great care must be exercised or we
shall go astray in depicting the work of the school in dealing with
this subject of language. The child comes into the school with
language of a sort, but it needs rectification in order to render
it readily available for the purposes of society. Herein lies the
crux of the whole matter. If this child were not to become a member
of society, it would matter little what sort of language he uses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name=
"page212"></a>212</span>or whether he uses any language. If he were
to be banished to some island there to dwell alone, language would
be unnecessary. Hence, his study of language in the school is,
primarily, for the well-being of society and not for himself.
Language is so essential to the life processes that, without it,
society would be thrown out of balance. The needs of society are
paramount, and hence language as it concerns the child relates to
him chiefly if not wholly as a member of society.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Grammar.</span>&mdash;Grammar is nothing
else than language reduced to a system of common terms that have
been agreed upon in the interests of society. People have entered
into a linguistic compact, an agreement that certain words and
combinations of words shall be understood to mean certain things.
The tradesman must understand the purchaser or there can be no
exchange. The ticket-agent must understand the prospective traveler
or the latter cannot take the journey and reach his destination.
Hence, grammar, with all that the term implies, is a means of
facilitating the activities of society and pertains to the
individual only in his relation to society.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Needs of society.</span>&mdash;True, the
individual will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name=
"page213"></a>213</span>find life more agreeable in society if he
understands the common language, just as the traveler is more
comfortable in a foreign country if he understands its language.
But we need emphasis upon the statement that we have grammar in the
school because it is one of the needs of society. The individual
may not need chemistry, but society does need it, and the school
must somehow provide it because of this need. Hence we place
chemistry in the school as one of the ingredients of the solvent
which we employ in the process of rectification. Those who are
susceptible to the influences of this ingredient will become
inoculated with it and bear it forth into the uses of society.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Caution.</span>&mdash;But just here we
find the most delicate and difficult task of the school. Here we
encounter some of the fundamental principles of psychology as
explained and emphasized by James, McDougall, and Strayer. Here we
must begin our quest for the native tendencies that condition
successful teaching. We must discover what pupils are susceptible
to chemistry before we can proceed with the work of inoculation.
This has been the scene and source of many tragedies. We have been
wont to ask whether chemistry will be good for the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>214</span>boy instead
of making an effort to discover whether the boy will be good for
chemistry&mdash;whether his native tendencies render him
susceptible to chemistry.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Some mistakes.</span>&mdash;Our procedure
has often come but little short of an inquisition. We have followed
our own predilections and prejudices instead of being docile at the
feet of Nature and asking her what to do. We have applied
opprobrious epithets and resorted to ostracism. We have been freely
dispensing suspensions and expulsions in a vain effort to prove
that the school is both omniscient and omnipotent. We have tried to
transform a poet into a mechanic, a blacksmith into an artist, and
an astronomer into a ditcher. And our complacency in the presence
of the misfits of the school is the saddest tragedy of all. We have
taken counsel with tradition rather than with the nature of the
pupil, the while rejoicing in our own infallibility.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Native dispositions.</span>&mdash;Society
needs only a limited number of chemists and only such as have the
native tendencies that will make chemistry most effective in the
activities of society. But we have been proceeding upon the
agreeable assumption that every pupil has such native tendencies.
Such <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name=
"page215"></a>215</span>an assumption absolves the school, of
course, from the necessity of discovering what pupils are
susceptible to chemistry and of devising ways and means of making
this important discovery. Because we do not know how to make this
discovery we find solace in the assumption that it cannot or need
not be made. We then proceed to apply the Procrustean bed principle
with the very acme of <i>sang froid</i>. Here is work for the
efficiency expert. When children are sitting at the table of life,
the home and the school in combination ought to be able to discover
what food they crave and not insist upon their eating olives when
they really crave oatmeal.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The ideal of the school.</span>&mdash;We
shall not have attained to right conditions until such time as the
stream of life that issues from the school shall combine the
agencies, in right proportions and relations, that will conserve
the best interests of society and administer its activities with
the maximum of efficiency. This is the ideal that the school must
hold up before itself as the determining plan in its every
movement. But this ideal presupposes no misfits in society. If
there are such, then it will decline in some degree from the plane
of highest efficiency. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name=
"page216"></a>216</span>If there are some members of society who
are straining at the leash which Nature provided for them and are
trying to do work for which they have neither inclination nor
aptitude, they cannot render the best service, and society suffers
in consequence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Misfits.</span>&mdash;The books teem with
examples of people who are striving to find themselves by finding
their work. But nothing has been said of society in this same
strain. We have only to think of society as composed of all the
people to realize that only by finding its work can society find
itself. And so long as there is even one member of society who has
not found himself, so long must we look upon this one exception as
a discordant note in the general harmony. If one man is working at
the forge who by nature is fitted for a place at the desk, then
neither this man nor society is at its best. And a large measure of
the responsibility for such discord and misfits in society must be
laid at the door of the school because of its inability to discover
native tendencies.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Common interests.</span>&mdash;There are
many interests that all children have in common when they enter the
school in the morning, and these interests may well become the
starting points in the day&rsquo;s work. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>217</span>The
conversations at breakfast tables and the morning paper beget and
stimulate many of these interests and the school does violence to
the children, the community, and itself if it attempts to taboo
these interests. Its work is to rectify and not to suppress. When
the children return to their homes in the evening they should have
clearer and larger conceptions of the things that animated them in
the morning. If they come into the school all aglow with interest
in the great snowstorm of the night before, the teacher does well
to hold the lesson in decimals in abeyance until she has led around
to the subject by means of readings or stories that have to do with
snowstorms. The paramount and common interest of the children in
the morning is snow and, therefore, the day should hold snow in the
foreground in their thinking, so that, at the close of the day,
their horizon in the snow-world may be extended, and so that they
may thus be able to make contributions to the home on the subject
of snow.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Real interests.</span>&mdash;In the
morning the pupils had objective snow in which they rollicked and
gamboled in glee. All day long they had subjective snow in which
the teacher with fine technique caused them to revel; and, in the
evening, their concept of snow <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page218" name="page218"></a>218</span>was so much enlarged that
they experienced a fresh access of delight. And that day was their
snow epiphany. On that day there was no break in the stream of life
at the schoolhouse door. There was no supplanting of the real
interests of the morning with fictitious interests of the school,
to be endured with ill grace until the real interests of the
morning could be resumed in the evening. On the contrary, by some
magic that only the vitalized teacher knows, every exercise of the
day seemed to have snow as its center. Snow seemed to be the major
in the reading, in the spelling, in the geography, and in the
history.</p>
<p>On that day they became acquainted with Hannibal and his
struggles through the snow of the Alps. On that day they learned of
the avalanche, its origin, its devastating power, and, of course,
its spelling. On that day they read &ldquo;Snow Bound&rdquo; and
the snow poems of Longfellow and Lowell. Thus the stream of life
was clarified, rectified, and amplified as it passed through the
school, and, incidentally, the teacher and the school were
glorified in their thoughts.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Circus day.</span>&mdash;But snow is
merely typical. On other days other interests are paramount. On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name=
"page219"></a>219</span>circus day the children, again, have a
common interest which affords the teacher a supreme opportunity.
The day has been anticipated by the teacher, and the pupils have
cause to wonder how and whence she ever accumulated such a wealth
of pictures of animal life. All day long they are regaled with a
subjective menagerie, and when they attend the circus in the
evening they astonish their parents by the extent and accuracy of
their information. They know the animals by name, their habitat,
their habits, their food, and their uses. In short, they seemed to
have compassed a working knowledge of the animal kingdom in a
single day through the skill of the teacher who knows how to make
the school re&euml;nforce their life interests.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The quality of life.</span>&mdash;If we
now extend the scope of common interests that belong in the
category with the snow and the animals, we shall readily see that
the analogy of the filtration-plant holds good in the entire
r&eacute;gime of the vitalized school. But we must never lose sight
of the additional fact that the quality of life that issues from
the school is far better because of its passage through the school.
The volume may be less, through unfortunate leakage, but the
quality is so much better that its value <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>220</span>to society
is enhanced a hundred- or a thousand-fold. The people who pass
through the school have learned a common language, have been imbued
with a common purpose, have learned how to live and work in hearty
accord, have come to revere a common flag, and have become citizens
of a common country.</p>

<h3>POETRY AND LIFE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Poetry defined.</span>&mdash;Poetry has
been defined as &ldquo;a message from the heart of the artist to
the heart of the man&rdquo;; and, seeing that the heart is the
center and source of life, it follows that poetry is a means of
effecting a transfusion of life. The poet ponders life long and
deeply and then gives forth an interpretation in artistic form that
is surcharged with the very quintessence of life. The poet absorbs
life from a thousand sources&mdash;the sky, the forest, the
mountain, the sunrise, the ocean, the storm, the child in the
mother&rsquo;s arms, and the man at his work, and then transmits it
that the recipient may have a new influx of life. The poet&rsquo;s
quest is life, his theme is life, and his gift to man is life. His
mission is to gain a larger access of life and to give life in
greater abundance. He gains the meaning of life from the snowflake
and the avalanche; from the grain of sand and the fertile valley;
from the raindrop and the sea; from the chirp of the cricket
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name=
"page223"></a>223</span>and the crashing of the thunder; from the
firefly and the lightning&rsquo;s flash; and from Vesuvius and
Sinai. To know life he listens to the baby&rsquo;s prattle, the
mother&rsquo;s lullaby, and the father&rsquo;s prayer; he looks
upon faces that show joy and sorrow, hope and despair, defeat and
triumph; and he feels the pulsations of the tides, the hurricane,
and the human heart.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">How the poet learns life.</span>&mdash;He
sits beside the bed of sickness and hears the feeble and broken
words that tell of the past, the present, and the future; he visits
the field of battle and sees the wreckage of the passions of men;
he goes into the dungeon and hears the ravings and revilings of a
distorted soul; he visits pastoral scenes where peace and plenty
unite in a song of praise; he rides the mighty ship and knows the
heartbeats of the ocean; he sits within the church and opens the
doors of his soul to its holy influences; he enters the hovel whose
squalor proclaims it the abode of ignorance and vice; he visits the
home of happiness where industry and frugality pour forth their
bounteous gifts and love sways its gentle scepter; and he sits at
the feet of his mother and imbibes her gracious spirit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name=
"page224"></a>224</span><span class="paraHead">Transfusion of
life.</span>&mdash;And then he writes; and as he writes his pen
drips life. He knows and feels, and, therefore, he expresses, and
his words are the distillations of life. His spiritual percipience
has rendered his soul a veritable garden of emotions, and with his
pen he transplants these in the written page. And men see and come
to pluck the flowers to transplant again in their own souls that
they, too, may have a garden like unto his. His <i>&eacute;lan</i>
carries over into the lives of these men and they glow with the
ardor of his emotions and are inspired to deeds of courage, of
service, and of solace. For every flower plucked from his garden
another grows in its stead more beautiful and more fragrant than
its fellow, and he is reinspired as he inspires others. And thus in
this transfusion of life there is an undertow that carries back
into his own life and makes his spirit more fertile.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Aspiration.</span>&mdash;When he would
teach men to aspire he writes &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; and so causes
them to know that only he who aspires really lives. They see the
groundling, the boor, the drudge, and the clown content to dwell in
the valley amid the loaves and fishes of animal desires, while the
man who aspires is struggling toward the heights whence he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name=
"page225"></a>225</span>may gain an outlook upon the glories that
are, know the throb and thrill of new life, and experience the
swing and sweep of spiritual impulses. He makes them to know that
the man who aspires recks not of cold, of storm, or of snow, if
only he may reach the summit and lave his soul in the glory that
crowns the marriage of earth and sky. They feel that the aspirant
is but yielding obedience to the behests of his better self to
scale the heights where sublimity dwells.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Perseverance.</span>&mdash;Or he writes
the fourth &ldquo;&AElig;neid&rdquo; to make men feel that the palm
of victory comes only to those who persevere to the end; that duty
does not abdicate in favor of inclination; and that the high gods
will not hold guiltless the man who stops short of Italy to loiter
and dally in Carthage even in the sunshine of a Dido&rsquo;s smile.
When Italy is calling, no siren song of pleasure must avail to lure
him from his course, nor must his sail be furled until the keel
grates upon the Italian shore. His navigating skill must guide him
through the perils of Scylla and Charybdis and the stout heart of
manhood must bear him past Mount &AElig;tna&rsquo;s fiery menace.
His dauntless courage must brave the anger of the greedy waves and
boldly ride them down. Nor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226"
name="page226"></a>226</span>must his cup of joy be full until the
wished-for land shall greet his eager eyes.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Overweening ambition.</span>&mdash;Or,
again, the poet may yearn to teach the wrong of overweening,
vaulting ambition and he writes &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Recessional.&rdquo; He pictures Satan overthrown, like the
Giants who would climb into the throne on Olympus. He pictures Hell
as the fitting place for Satan overthrown, and in his own place he
pictures the outcast and downcast Satan writhing and cursing
because he was balked of his unholy ambition. And, lest mortals
sink from their high estate, borne down by their sins of
unsanctified ambition, he prays, and prays again, &ldquo;Lord God
of Hosts, be with us yet, lest we forget, lest we forget.&rdquo;
And the prayer echoes and re&euml;choes in the soul of the man, and
the world sees his lips moving in the prayer of the poet,
&ldquo;Lest we forget, lest we forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Native land.</span>&mdash;Or, again, he
writes Bannockburn and the spirit is fired with patriotic devotion
to native land. We hear the bagpipe and the drum and see the
martial clans gathering in serried ranks and catch the glint of
their arms and armor as they flash back the sunlight. We hear their
lusty calls as they rush together to defend the hills and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name=
"page227"></a>227</span>homes they love. We see, again, the Wallace
and the Bruce inciting valorous men to deeds of heroism and hear
the hills re&euml;choing with the shock of steel upon steel. From
hill to hill the pibroch leaps, and hearts and feet quicken at its
sound. And mothers are pressing their bairns to their bosoms as
they cheer their loved ones away to the strife. And while their
eyes are weeping their hearts are saying:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Wha will be a traitor knave?</p>
<p>Wha can fill a coward&rsquo;s grave?</p>
<p>Wha so base as be a slave?</p>
<p>Let him turn and flee!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="paraHead">Faith.</span>&mdash;And after the sounds
of battle are hushed he sings &ldquo;To Mary in Heaven&rdquo; and
causes the man to stand in the presence of the Burning Bush and to
hear the command &ldquo;Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.&rdquo; And the
heart of the man grows tender as the poet opens his eyes to catch a
glimpse of the life of faith that the star foretells even as the
Star of Bethlehem was prophetic. And, through the eyes of the
lover, he looks over into the other life and knows that his faith
is not in vain. And when faith sits enthroned, the music of the
brook at his feet becomes sweeter, the stars shine more brightly,
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name=
"page228"></a>228</span>earth becomes a place of gladness, and life
is far more worth while. The poet has caused the scales to fall
from his eyes and through them the light of Heaven has streamed
into his soul.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher&rsquo;s influx of
life.</span>&mdash;And the teacher imbibes the spirit of the poet
and becomes vital and thus becomes attuned to all life. Flowers
spring up in her pathway because they are claiming kinship with the
flowers that are blooming in her soul. The insect chirps forth its
music, and her own spirit joins in the chorus of the forest. The
brooklet laughs as it ripples its way toward the sea, and her
spirit laughs in unison because the poet has poured his laughter
into her soul. She stands unafraid in the presence of the storm
because her feeling for majesty overmasters her apprehension of
danger. The lightning&rsquo;s flash may rend the oak but, even so,
she stands in mute admiration at this wondrous manifestation of
life. Her quickened spirit responds to the roll and reverberation
of the thunder because she has grown to womanhood through the
poet&rsquo;s copious draughts of life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The book of life.</span>&mdash;The voices
of the night enchant her and the stars take her into their
counsels. The swaying tree speaks her language because both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name=
"page229"></a>229</span>speak the language of life. She takes
delight in the lexicon of the planets because it interprets to her
the book of life, and in the revelations of this book she finds her
chief joy. For her there are no dull moments whether she wanders by
the river, through the glades, or over the hills, because she is
ever turning the pages of this book. She moves among the things of
life and accounts them all her friends and companions. She knows
their moods and their language and with them holds intimate
communion. They smile upon her because she can reciprocate their
smiles. Life to her is a buoyant, a joyous experience each hour of
the day because the poet has poured into her spirit its fuller,
deeper meanings.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teaching.</span>&mdash;And because
the poet has touched her spirit with the wand of his power the
waters of life gush forth in sparkling abundance. And children come
to the fountain of her life and drink of its waters and are thereby
refreshed and invigorated. Then they smile back their gratitude to
her in their exuberance of joyous life.</p>

<h3>A SENSE OF HUMOR</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">An American story.</span>&mdash;There is
a story to the effect that a certain Mr. Jones was much given to
boasting of his early rising. He stoutly maintained that he was
going about his work every morning at three o&rsquo;clock. Some of
his friends were inclined to be incredulous as to his
representations and entered into a kindly conspiracy to put them to
the test. Accordingly one of the number presented himself at the
kitchen door of the Jones residence one morning at half-past three
and made inquiry of Mrs. Jones as to the whereabouts of her
husband, asking if he was at home. In a very gracious manner Mrs.
Jones replied: &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t here now. He was around
here early this morning but I don&rsquo;t really know where he is
now.&rdquo; This is a clean, fine, typical American story, and, by
means of such a story, we can test for a sense of humor. The boy in
school will laugh at this story both because it is a good one and
because he is a normal boy. If he does not <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>232</span>laugh at
such a story, there is cause for anxiety as to his mental condition
or attitude. If the teacher cannot or does not laugh, a disharmony
is generated at once between teacher and pupil which militates
against the well-being of the school. If the teacher reprimands the
boy, the boy as certainly discredits the teacher and all that she
represents. If she cannot enjoy such a wholesome story, he feels
that her arithmetic, geography, and grammar are responsible, and
these studies decline somewhat in his esteem. Moreover, he feels
that the teacher&rsquo;s reprimand was unwarranted and unjust and
he fain would consort with people of his own kind. Many a boy
deserts school because the teacher is devoid of the saving grace of
humor. Her inability to see or have any fun in life makes him
uncomfortable and he seeks a more agreeable environment.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Humor in its
manifestations.</span>&mdash;A sense of humor diffuses itself
through all the activities of life, giving to them all a gentle
quality that eliminates asperities and renders them gracious and
amiable. Like fireflies that bespangle the darkness of the night,
humor scintillates through all life&rsquo;s phases and activities
and causes the day to go more pleasantly and effectively on. It
twinkles through the thoughts <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233"
name="page233"></a>233</span>and gives to language a sparkle and a
nicety that cause it to appeal to the artistic sense. It gives to
discourse a piquancy that stimulates but does not irritate. It is
the flavor that gives to speech its undulatory quality, and redeems
it from desert sameness. It pervades the motives and gives
direction as well as a pleasing fertility to all behavior. It is
pervasive without becoming obtrusive. It steals into the senses as
quietly as the dawn and causes life to smile. Wit may flash, but
humor blithely glides into the consciousness with a radiant and
kindly smile upon its face. Wit may sting and inflame, but humor
soothes and comforts. The man who has a generous admixture of humor
in his nature is an agreeable companion and a sympathetic friend to
grown-up people, to children, and to animals. His spirit is genial,
and people become kindly and magnanimous in his presence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">One of John B. Gough&rsquo;s
stories.</span>&mdash;The celebrated John B. Gough was wont to tell
a story that was accounted one of his many masterpieces. It was a
story of a free-for-all convention where any one, according to
inclination, had the privilege of freely speaking his sentiments.
When the first speaker had concluded, a man in the audience called
lustily for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name=
"page234"></a>234</span>a speech from Mr. Henry. Then another
spoke, and, again, more lustily than before, the man demanded Mr.
Henry. More and more vociferous grew the call for Mr. Henry after
each succeeding speech until, at last, the chairman with some
acrimony exclaimed: &ldquo;The man who is calling for Mr. Henry
will please be quiet. It is Mr. Henry who is now speaking.&rdquo;
The man thus rebuked was somewhat crestfallen, but managed to say,
as if in a half-soliloquy: &ldquo;Mr. Henry! Why, that ain&rsquo;t
Mr. Henry. That&rsquo;s the little chap that told me to
holler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of one of his lectures in which Mr. Gough told
this story in his inimitable style, a man came to the platform and
explained to him that he had a friend who seemed to lack a sense of
humor and wondered if he might not prevail upon Mr. Gough to tell
him this particular story in the hope that it would cause him to
laugh. In a spirit of adventure Mr. Gough consented, and at the
time appointed told the story to the old gentleman in his own best
style. The old gentleman seemed to be deeply interested, but at the
conclusion of the story, instead of laughing heartily as his friend
had hoped, he solemnly asked, &ldquo;What did he tell him to holler
fur?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name=
"page235"></a>235</span><span class="paraHead">The man who lacks a
sense of humor.</span>&mdash;There was no answer to this question,
or, rather, he himself was the answer. Such a man is obviously
outside the pale, without hope of redemption. If such a story, told
by such a <i>raconteur</i>, could not touch him, he is hopeless. In
his spiritual landscape there are no undulations, but it reveals
itself as a monotonous dead-level without stream or verdure. He
eats, and sleeps, and walks about, but he walks in a spiritual
daze. To him life must seem a somber, drab affair. If he were a
teacher in a traditional school, he would chill and depress, but he
might be tolerated because a sense of humor is not one of the
qualifications of the teacher. But, in the vitalized school, he
would be intolerable. If children should go to such a teacher for
spiritual refreshment, they would return thirsty. He has nothing to
give them, no bubbling water of life, no geniality, no such graces
of the spirit as appeal to buoyant childhood. He lacks a sense of
humor, and that lack makes arid the exuberant sources of life. He
may solve problems in arithmetic, but he cannot compass the
solution of the problem of life. The children pity him, and no
greater calamity can befall a teacher than to deserve and receive
the pity of a child. He might, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page236" name="page236"></a>236</span>in a way, teach anatomy, but
not physiology. He might be able to deal with the analytic. He
might succeed as curator in a museum of mummies, but he will fail
as a teacher of children.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Story of a boy.</span>&mdash;A
seven-year-old boy who was lying on his back on the floor asked his
father the question, &ldquo;How long since the world was
born?&rdquo; The father replied, &ldquo;Oh, about four thousand
years.&rdquo; In a few moments the child said in a tone of
finality, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t very long.&rdquo; Then after
another interval, he asked, &ldquo;What was there before the world
was born?&rdquo; To this the father replied, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
After a lapse of two or three minutes the child gave vent to
uncontrollable laughter which resounded throughout the house. When,
at length, the father asked him what he was laughing at, he could
scarcely control his laughter to answer. But at last he managed to
reply, &ldquo;I was laughing to see how funny it was when there
wasn&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s
imagination.</span>&mdash;The philosopher could well afford to give
the half of his kingdom to be able to see what that child saw. Out
of the gossamer threads of fancy his imagination had wrought a
pattern that transcends philosophy. The picture that his
imagination painted was so extraordinary <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>237</span>that it
produced a paroxysm of laughter. That picture is far beyond the ken
of the philosopher and he will look for it in vain because he has
grown away from the child in power of imagination and has lost the
child&rsquo;s sense of humor. What that child saw will never be
known, for the pictures of fancy are ephemeral, but certain it is
that the power of imagination and a keen sense of humor are two of
the attributes of childhood whose loss should give both his father
and his teacher poignant regrets.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The little girl and her
elders.</span>&mdash;The little girl upon the beach invests the
tiny wavelets not only with life and intelligence, but, also, with
a sense of humor as she eludes their sly advances to engulf her
feet. She laughs in glee at their watery pranks as they twinkle and
sparkle, now advancing, now receding, trying to take her by
surprise. She chides them for their duplicity, then extols them for
their prankish playfulness. She makes them her companions, and they
laugh in chorus. If she knows of sprites, and gnomes, and nymphs,
and fairies, she finds them all dancing in glee at her feet in the
form of rippling wavelets. And while she is thus refreshing her
spirit from the brimming cup of life, her matter-of-fact elders are
reproaching her for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name=
"page238"></a>238</span>getting her dress soiled. To the parent or
the teacher who lacks a sense of humor and cannot enter into the
little girl&rsquo;s conception of life, a dress is of more
importance than the spirit of the child. But the teacher or the
parent who has the &ldquo;aptitude for vicariousness&rdquo; that
enables her to enter into the child&rsquo;s life in her fun and
frolic with the playful water, and can feel the presence of the
nymphs among the wavelets,&mdash;such a teacher or parent will
adorn the school or the home and endear herself to the child.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Lincoln&rsquo;s humor.</span>&mdash;The
life of Abraham Lincoln affords a notable illustration of the
saving power of humor. Reared in conditions of hardship, his early
life was essentially drab and prosaic. In temperament he was
serious, with an inclination toward the morbid, but his sense of
humor redeemed the situation. When clouds of gloom and
discouragement lowered in his mental sky, his keen sense of humor
penetrated the darkness and illumined his pathway. He was sometimes
the object of derision because men could not comprehend the depth
and bigness of his nature, and his humor was often accounted a
weakness. But the Gettysburg speech rendered further derision
impossible and the wondrous alchemy <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page239" name="page239"></a>239</span>of that address transmuted
criticism into willing praise.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Humor betokens deep
feeling.</span>&mdash;Laughter and tears issue from the same
source, we are told, and the Gettysburg speech revealed a depth and
a quality of tenderness that men had not, before, been able to
recognize or appreciate. The absence of a sense of humor betokens
shallowness in that it reveals an inability to feel deeply. People
who feel deeply often laugh in order to forestall tears. Lincoln
was a great soul and his sense of humor was one element of his
greatness. His apt stories and his humorous personal experiences
often carried off a situation where cold logic would have failed.
Whether his sense of humor was a gift or an acquisition, it
certainly served the nation well and gave to us all an example that
is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teacher of English.</span>&mdash;Many
teachers could, with profit to themselves and their schools, sit at
the feet of Abraham Lincoln, not only to learn English but also to
imbibe his sense of humor. Nothing is more pathetic than the
efforts of a teacher who lacks a sense of humor to teach a bit of
English that abounds in humor, by means of the textual notes. The
notes are bad enough, in all conscience, but the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page240" name=
"page240"></a>240</span>teacher&rsquo;s lack of humor piles Ossa
upon Pelion. The solemnity that pervades such mechanical teaching
would be farcical were it not so pathetic. The teacher who cannot
indulge in a hearty, honest, ringing laugh with her pupils in
situations that are really humorous is certain to be laughed at by
her pupils. In her work, as in Lincoln&rsquo;s, a sense of humor
will often save the day.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Mark Twain as
philosopher.</span>&mdash;Mark Twain will ever be accounted a very
prince of humorists, and so he was. But he was more than that. Upon
the current of his humor were carried precious cargoes of the
philosophy of life. His humor is often so subtle that the
superficial reader fails to appreciate its fine quality and misses
the philosophy altogether. To extract the full meaning from his
writing one must be able to read not only between the lines but
also beneath the lines. The subtle quality of his humor defies both
analysis and explanation. If it fails to tell its own story, so
much the worse for the reader. To such humor as his, explanation
amounts to an impertinence. People can either appreciate it or else
they cannot, and there&rsquo;s the end of the matter.</p>
<p>In the good time to come when the school teaches reading for the
purpose of pleasure and not for examination <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>241</span>purposes, we
shall have Mark Twain as one of our authors; and it is to be hoped
that we shall have editions devoid of notes. The notes may serve to
give the name of the editor a place on the title page, but the
notes cannot add to the enjoyment of the author&rsquo;s genial
humor. Mark Twain reigns supreme, and the editor does well to stand
uncovered in his presence and to withhold his pen.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">A Twain story.</span>&mdash;One of Mark
Twain&rsquo;s stories is said to be one of the most humorous
stories extant. The story relates how a soldier was rushing off the
battlefield in retreat when a companion, whose leg was shattered,
begged to be carried off the field. The appeal met a willing
response and soon the soldier was bearing his companion away on his
shoulder, his head hanging down the soldier&rsquo;s back. Unknown
to the soldier a cannon ball carried away the head of his
companion. Accosted by another soldier, he was asked why he was
carrying a man whose head had been shot away. He stoutly denied the
allegation and, at length, dropped the headless body to prove the
other&rsquo;s hallucination. Seeing that the man&rsquo;s head was,
in truth, gone, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, the durn fool told me it
was his leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name=
"page242"></a>242</span><span class="paraHead">Humor defies
explanation.</span>&mdash;The humor of this story is cumulative. We
may not parse it, we may not analyze it, we may not annotate it. We
can simply enjoy it. And, if we cannot enjoy it, we may pray for a
spiritual awakening, for such an endowment of the sense of humor as
will enable us to enjoy, that we may no longer lead lives that are
spiritually blind. Bill Nye wrote:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The autumn leaves are falling,</p>
<p>They are falling everywhere;</p>
<p>They are falling through the atmosphere</p>
<p>And likewise through the air.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Woe betide the teacher who tries to explain! There is no
explanation&mdash;there is just the humor. If that eludes the
reader, an explanation will not avail.</p>
<p>A teacher of Latin read to his pupils &ldquo;The House-Boat on
the Styx&rdquo; in connection with their reading of the
&ldquo;&AElig;neid.&rdquo; It was good fun for them all, and never
was Virgil more highly honored than in the assiduous study which
those young people gave to his lines. They were eager to complete
the study of the lesson in order to have more time for the
&ldquo;House-Boat.&rdquo; The humor of the book opened wide the
gates of their spirits through which the truths of the regular
lesson passed blithely in.</p>

<h3>The Element of Human Interest</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Yearning toward
betterment.</span>&mdash;Much has been said and written in recent
times touching the matter and manner of vitalizing and humanizing
the studies and work of the school. The discussions have been
nation-wide in their scope and most fertile in plans and practical
suggestions. No subject of greater importance or of more
far-reaching import now engages the interest of educational
leaders. They are quite aware that something needs to be done, but
no one has announced the sovereign remedy. The critics have made
much of the fact that there is something lacking or wrong in our
school procedure, but they can neither diagnose the case nor
suggest the remedy. They can merely criticize. We are having many
surveys, but the results have been meager and inadequate. We have
been working at the circumference of the circle rather than at the
center. We have been striving to reform our educational training,
hoping for a reflex that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245"
name="page245"></a>245</span>would be sufficient to modify the
entire school r&eacute;gime. We have added domestic science, hoping
thereby to reconstruct the school by inoculation. We have looked to
agriculture and other vocational studies as the magnetic influences
of our dreams. Something has been accomplished, to be sure, but we
are still far distant from the goal. The best that writers can do
in their books or educational conferences can do in their meetings,
is to report progress.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The obstacle of
conservatism.</span>&mdash;One of the greatest obstacles we have to
surmount in this whole matter of vitalizing school work is the
habitual conservatism of the school people themselves. The methods
of teaching that obtained in the school when we were pupils have
grooved themselves into habits of thinking that smile defiance at
the theories that we have more recently acquired. When we venture
out from the shore we want to feel a rope in our hands. The
superintendent speaks fervently to patrons or teachers on the
subject of modern methods in teaching, then retires to his office
and takes intimate and friendly counsel with tradition. In sailing
the educational seas he must needs keep in sight the buoys of
tradition. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name=
"page246"></a>246</span>This matter of conservatism is cited merely
to show that our progress, in the very nature of the case, will be
slow.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Schools of
education.</span>&mdash;Another obstacle in the way of progress
toward the vitalized school is the attitude and teaching of many
who are connected with colleges of education and normal schools. We
have a right to look to them for leadership, but we find, instead,
that their practices lag far in the rear of their theories. They
teach according to such devitalized methods and in such an
unvitalized way as to discredit the subjects they teach. It is only
from such of their students as are proof against their style of
teaching that we may hope for aid. One such teacher in a college of
education in a course of eight weeks on the subject of School
Administration had his students copy figures from statistical
reports for several days in succession and for four and five hours
each day. The students confessed that their only objective was the
gaining of credits, and had no intimation that the work they were
doing was to function anywhere.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The machine teacher.</span>&mdash;Such
work is deadening and disheartening. It has in it no inspiration,
no life, nothing, in short, that connects with real life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name=
"page247"></a>247</span>Such a teacher could not maintain himself
in a wide-awake high school for a half year. The boys and girls
would desert him even if they had to desert the school. And yet
teachers and prospective teachers must endure and not complain.
Those who submit supinely will attempt to repeat in their schools
the sort of teaching that obtains in his classes, and their schools
will suffer accordingly. His sort of teaching proclaims him either
more or less than a human being in the estimation of normal people.
Such a teacher drones forth weary platitudes as if his utterances
were oracular. The only prerequisite for a position in some schools
of education seems to be a degree of a certain altitude without any
reference to real teaching ability.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Statistics versus
children.</span>&mdash;Such teaching palliates educational
situations without affording a solution. It is so steeped in
tradition that it resorts to statistics as it would consult an
oracle. We look to see it establishing precedents only to find it
following precedents. When we would find in it a leader we find
merely a follower. To such teaching statistical numbers mean far
more than living children. Indeed, children are but objects that
become useful as a means of proving theories. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>248</span>It lacks
vitality, and that is sad; but, worst of all, it strives
unceasingly to perpetuate itself in the schools. Real teaching
power receives looks askance in some of these colleges as if it
bore the mark of Cain in not being up to standard on the academic
side. And yet these colleges are teaching the teachers of our
schools.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Teaching power.</span>&mdash;Hence, the
work of vitalizing the school must begin in our colleges of
education and normal schools, and this beginning will be made only
when we place the emphasis upon teaching power. The human qualities
of the teachers must be so pronounced that they become their most
distinguished characteristics. It is a sad commentary upon our
educational processes if a man must point to the letters of his
degree to prove that he is a teacher. His teaching should be of
such a nature as to justify and glorify his degree. As the preacher
receives his degree because he can preach, so the teacher should
receive his degree because he can teach, even if we must create a
new degree by which to designate the real teacher.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Degrees and human
qualities.</span>&mdash;There is no disparagement of the academic
degree in the statement that it proves absolutely nothing touching
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name=
"page249"></a>249</span>ability to teach. It proclaims its
possessor a student but not a teacher. Yet, in our practices, we
proceed upon the assumption that teacher and student are
synonymous. We hold examinations for teachers in our schools, but
not for teachers in our colleges of education. His degree is the
magic talisman that causes the doors to swing wide open for him.
Besides, his very presence inside seems to be prima facie evidence
that he is a success, and all his students are supposed to join in
the general chorus of praise.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Life the great human
interest.</span>&mdash;The books are eloquent and persistent in
their admonitions that we should attach all school work to the
native interests of the child. To this dictum there seems to be
universal and hearty assent. But we do not seem to realize fully,
as yet, that the big native interest of the child is life itself.
We have not, as yet, found the way to enmesh the activities of the
school in the life processes of the child so that these school
activities are as much a part of his life as his food, his games,
his breathing, and his sleep. We have been interpreting some of the
manifestations of life as his native interests but have failed thus
to interpret his life as a whole. The child is but the aggregate of
all his inherent interests, and <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page250" name="page250"></a>250</span>we must know these interests
if we would find the child so as to attach school work to the child
himself.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child as a whole.</span>&mdash;Here
is the crux of the entire matter, here the big problem for the
vitalized school. We have been taking his pulse, testing his eyes,
taking his temperature, and making examinations for
defects&mdash;and these things are excellent. But all these things
combined do not reveal the child to us. We need to go beyond all
these in order to find him. We must know what he thinks, how he
feels as to people and things, what his aspirations are, what
motives impel him to action, what are his intuitions, what things
he does involuntarily and what through volition or compulsion. With
such data clearly before us we can proceed to attach school work to
his native interests. We have been striving to bend him to our
preconceived notion instead of finding out who and what he is as a
condition precedent to intelligent teaching.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Three types of teachers.</span>&mdash;The
three types of teachers that have been much exploited in the books
are the teacher who conceives it to be her work to teach the book,
the one who teaches the subject, and the one who teaches the child.
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name=
"page251"></a>251</span>number of the first type is still very
large in spite of all the books that inveigh against this
conception. It were easy to find a teacher whose practice indicates
that she thinks that all the arithmetic there is or ought to be is
to be found in the book that lies on her desk. It seems not to
occur to her that a score of books might be written that would be
equal in merit to the one she is using, some of which might be far
better adapted to the children in her particular school. If she
were asked to teach arithmetic without the aid of a book, she would
shed copious tears, if, indeed, she did not resign.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The first type.</span>&mdash;To such a
teacher the book is the Ultima Thule of all her endeavors, and when
the pupils can pass the examination she feels that her work is a
success. If the problem in the book does not fit the child, so much
the worse for the child, and she proceeds to try to make him fit
the problem. It does not occur to her to construct problems that
will fit the child. When she comes to the solution of the right
triangle, the baseball diamond does not come to her mind. She has
the boy learn a rule and try to apply it instead of having him find
the distance from first base to third in a direct line. In her
thinking such a proceeding would be banal <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>252</span>because it
would violate the sanctity of the book. She must adhere to the book
though the heavens fall, and the boy with them.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The book supreme.</span>&mdash;She seems
quite unable to draw upon the farm, the grocery, the store, or the
playground for suitable problems. These things seem to be obscured
by her supreme devotion to the book. She lacks fertility of
resources, nor does she realize this lack, because her eyes are
fastened upon the book rather than upon the child. Were she as
intent upon the child as she is upon the book, his interests would
direct attention to the things toward which his inclinations yearn
and toward which his aptitudes lure him. In such a case, her
ingenuity and resourcefulness would roam over wide fields in quest
of the objects of his native interests and she would return to him
laden with material that would fit the needs of the child far
better than the material of the book.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child supreme.</span>&mdash;The
teacher whose primary consideration is the child and who sees in
the child the object and focus of all her activities, never makes a
fetish of the book. It has its use, to be sure, but it is
subordinate in the scheme of education. It is not a necessity, but
a mere convenience. She could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253"
name="page253"></a>253</span>dispense with it entirely and not do
violence to the child&rsquo;s interests. No book is large enough to
compass all that she teaches, for she forages in every field to
obtain proper and palatable food for the child. She teaches with
the grain of the child and not against the grain. If the book
contains what she requires in her work, she uses it and is glad to
have it; but, if it does not contain what she needs, she seeks it
elsewhere and does not return empty-handed.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;She places
the truth she hopes to teach in the path of the child&rsquo;s
inclination, and this is taken into his life processes. Life does
not stop at way-stations to take on supplies, but absorbs the
supplies that it encounters as it moves along. This teacher does
not stop the ball game to teach the right triangle, but manages to
have the problem solved in connection with or as a part of the
game. She does not taboo the morning paper in order to have a
lesson in history, but begins with the paper as a favorable
starting point toward the lesson. She does not confiscate the
contents of the boy&rsquo;s pocket as contraband, but is glad to
avail herself of all these as indices of the boy&rsquo;s interests,
and, therefore, guides for her teaching.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name=
"page254"></a>254</span><span class="paraHead">Attitude toward
teaching materials.</span>&mdash;When the boy carries a toad to
school, she does not shudder, but rather rejoices, because she sees
in him a possible Agassiz. When he displays an interest in plant
life, she sees in him another Burbank. When she finds him drawing
pictures at his desk, she smiles approval, for she sees in him
another Raphael. She does not disdain the lowliest insect, reptile,
or plant when she finds it within the circle of the child&rsquo;s
interests. She is willing, nay eager, to ransack the universe if
only she may come upon elements of nutrition for her pupils. From
every flower that blooms she gathers honey that she may distill it
into the life of the child. She does not coddle the child; she
gives him nourishment.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">History.</span>&mdash;Her history is as
wide as human thought and as high as human aspiration. It includes
the Rosetta stone and the morning paper. It travels back from the
clothing of the child to the cotton gin. The stitch in the little
girl&rsquo;s dress is the index finger that points to the page that
depicts the invention of the sewing machine. Every engine leads her
back to Watt, and she takes the children with her. Every foreign
message in the daily paper revives the story of Field and the
laying of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name=
"page255"></a>255</span>the Atlantic cable. Every mention of the
President&rsquo;s cabinet gives occasion for reviewing the cabinets
of other Presidents with comparisons and contrasts. At her magic
touch the libraries and galleries yield forth rich treasures for
her classroom. Life is the textbook of her study, and the life of
the child is the goal of her endeavors.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The child&rsquo;s native
interests.</span>&mdash;In brief, she is teaching children and not
books or subjects, and the interests of the children take emphatic
precedence over her own. She enters into the life of the child and
makes excursions into all life according to the dictates of his
interests. The child is the big native interest to which she
attaches the work of the school. The program is elastic enough to
encompass every child in her school. Her program is a garden in
which something is growing for each child, and she cultivates every
plant with sympathetic care. She considers it no hardship to learn
the plant, the animal, the place, or the fact in which the child
finds interest. Because of the child and for the sake of the child
she invests all these things with the quality of human
interest.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The school and the
home.</span>&mdash;Arithmetic, language, history, and geography
touch life at a thousand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256"
name="page256"></a>256</span>points, and we have but to select the
points of contact with the life of each pupil to render any or all
of these a vital part of the day&rsquo;s work and the day&rsquo;s
life. They are not things that are detached from the child&rsquo;s
life. The child&rsquo;s errand to the shop involves arithmetic, and
the vitalized teacher makes this fact a part of the working capital
of the school. The dinner table abounds in geography, and the
teacher is quick to turn this fact to account in the school. Her
fertility of resources, coupled with her vital interest in human
beings and human affairs, soon establishes a reciprocal relation
between the home and the school. Similarly, she causes the language
of the school to flow out into the home, the factory, and the
office.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The skill of the
teacher.</span>&mdash;History is not a school affair merely. It is
a life affair, and through all the currents of life it may be made
to flow. The languages, Latin, German, French, Spanish, are
expressions and interpretations of life, and they may be made to
appear what they really are if the teacher is resourceful enough
and skillful enough to attach them to the life of the pupil by the
human ligaments that are ever at hand. Chemistry, physics, botany,
and physiology all throb with life if only the teacher <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>257</span>can place
the fingers of the pupils on their pulses. Given the human teacher,
the human child, and the humanized teaching, the vitalized school
is inevitable.</p>

<h2 class="chapterHead"><a id="Ch_XXI" name="Ch_XXI"></a>CHAPTER
XXI</h2>
<h3>BEHAVIOR</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Behavior in retrospect.</span>&mdash;The
caption of this chapter implies the behavior of human beings, as a
matter of course, and the study of this subject is, at once, both
alluring and illusive. No sooner has the student arrived at
deductions that seem conclusive than exceptions begin to loom up on
his speculative horizon that disintegrate his theories and cause
him to retrace the steps of his reasoning. Such a study affords
large scope for introspection, but too few people incline to
examine their own behavior in any mental attitude that approaches
the scientific. The others seem to think that things just happen,
and that their own behavior is fortuitous. They seem not to be able
to reason from effect back to cause, or to realize that there may
be any possible connection between what they are doing at the
present moment and what they were doing twenty years ago.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Environment.</span>&mdash;In what measure
is a man the product of his environment? To what extent is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name=
"page260"></a>260</span>a man able to influence his environment?
These questions start us on a line of inquiry that leads toward the
realm of, at least, a hypothetical solution of the problem of
behavior. After we have reached the conclusion, by means of
concrete examples, that many men have influenced their environment,
it becomes pertinent, at once, to inquire still further whence
these men derived the power thus to modify their environment. We
may not be able to reach final or satisfactory answers to these
questions, but it will, none the less, prove a profitable exercise.
We need not trench upon the theological doctrine of predestination,
but we may, with impunity, speculate upon the possibility of a
doctrine of educational predestination.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Queries.</span>&mdash;Was Mr. George
Goethals predestined to become the engineer of the Panama Canal
from the foundation of the world, or might he have become a farmer,
a physician, or a poet? Could Julius C&aelig;sar have turned back
from the Rubicon and refrained from saying, &ldquo;The die is
cast&rdquo;? Could Abraham Lincoln have withheld his pen from the
Emancipation Proclamation and permitted the negro race to continue
in slavery? Could any influence have deterred Walter Scott from
writing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name=
"page261"></a>261</span>&ldquo;Kenilworth&rdquo;? Was Robert
Fulton&rsquo;s invention of the steamboat inevitable? Could
Christopher Columbus possibly have done otherwise than discover
America? Does education have anything whatever to do in determining
what a man will or will not do?</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Antecedent causes.</span>&mdash;Here sits
a man, let us say, who is writing a musical selection. He works in
a veritable frenzy, and all else seems negligible for the time. He
well-nigh disdains food and sleep in the intensity of his interest.
Is this particular episode in his life merely happening, or does
some causative influence lie back of this event somewhere in the
years? Did some influence of home, or school, or playground give
him an impulse and an impetus toward this event? Or, in other
words, are the activities of his earlier life functioning on the
bit of paper before him? If this is an effect, what and where was
the cause? In the case of any type of human behavior can we
postulate antecedent causes? If a hundred musicians were writing
musical compositions at the same moment, would they offer similar
explanations of their behavior?</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Leadership.</span>&mdash;As a working
hypothesis, it may be averred that ability to influence environment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name=
"page262"></a>262</span>betokens leadership. With such a
measuring-rod in hand we may go out into the community and
determine, with some degree of accuracy, who are leaders and who
are mere followers. Then we should need to go further and discover
degrees of leadership, whether small or large, and, also, the
quality of the leadership, whether good or bad, wise or foolish,
selfish or altruistic, noisy or serene, and all the many other
variations. Having done all this, we are still only on the
threshold of our study, for we must reason back from our
accumulated facts to their antecedent causes. If we score one
man&rsquo;s leadership fifty and another&rsquo;s eighty, have we
any possible warrant for concluding that the influences in their
early life that tend to generate leadership were approximately as
five to eight?</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Restricted concepts.</span>&mdash;This
question is certain to encounter incredulity, just as it is certain
to raise other questions. Both results will be gratifying as
showing an awakening of interest, which is the most and the best
that the present discussion can possibly hope to accomplish. Very
many, perhaps most, teachers in the traditional school do their
teaching with reference to the next examination. They remind their
pupils daily of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name=
"page263"></a>263</span>on-coming examination and remind them of
the dire consequences following their failure to attain the passing
grade of seventy. They ask what answer the pupil would give to a
certain question if it should appear in the examination. If they
can somehow get their pupils to surmount that barrier of seventy at
promotion time, they seem quite willing to turn their backs upon
them and let the teacher in the next grade make what she can of
such unprofitable baggage.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Each lesson a prophecy.</span>&mdash;And
we still call this education. It isn&rsquo;t education at all, but
the merest hack work, and the tragedy of it is that the child is
the one to suffer. The teacher goes on her complacent way happy in
the consciousness that her pupils were promoted and, therefore, she
will retain her place on the pay roll. It were more logical to have
the same teacher continue with the pupil during his entire school
life of twelve years, for, in that case, her interest in him would
be continuous rather than temporary and spasmodic. But the present
plan of changing teachers would be even better than that if only
every teacher&rsquo;s work could be made to project itself not only
to graduation day, but to the days of mature manhood and womanhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name=
"page264"></a>264</span>If only every teacher were able to make
each lesson a vital prophecy of what the pupil is to be and to do
twenty years hence, then that lesson would become a condition
precedent to the pupil&rsquo;s future behavior.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Outlook.</span>&mdash;Groping about in
the twilight of possibilities we speculate in a mild and
superficial way as to the extent to which heredity, environment,
and education either singly or in combination are determining
factors in human behavior. But when no definite answer is
forthcoming we lose interest in the subject and have recourse to
the traditional methods of our grandfathers. We lose sight of the
fact that in our quest for the solution of this problem we are
coming nearer and nearer to the answer to the perennial question,
What is education? Hence, neither the time nor the effort is wasted
that we devote to this study. We may not understand heredity; we
may find ourselves bewildered by environment; we may not apprehend
what education is; but by keeping all these closely associated with
behavior in our thinking we shall be the gainers.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Long division ramified.</span>&mdash;We
are admonished so to organize the activities of the school that
they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name=
"page265"></a>265</span>may function in behavior. That is an
admonition of stupendous import as we discover when we attempt to
compass the content of behavior. One of the activities of the
school is Long Division. This is relatively simple, but the
possible behavior in which it may function is far less simple. In
the past, this same Long Division has functioned in the Brooklyn
Bridge, in the Hoosac Tunnel, and Washington Monument, in the
Simplon Pass, and in Eiffel Tower. It has helped us to travel up
the mountain side on funicular railways, underneath rivers and
cities by means of subways, under the ocean in submarines, and in
the air by means of aircraft, and over the tops of cities on
elevated railways. Only the prophet would have the temerity to
predict what further achievements the future holds in store. But
all that has been done and all that will yet be done are only a
part of the behavior in which this activity functions.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Behavior amplified.</span>&mdash;Human
behavior runs the entire gamut, from the bestial to the sublime,
with all the gradations between. It has to do with the mean thief
who pilfers the petty treasures of the little child, and with the
high-minded philanthropist who walks and works in obedience to the
behests <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name=
"page266"></a>266</span>of altruism. It includes the frowzy
slattern who offends the sight and also the high-born lady of
quality whose presence exhales and, therefore, inspires to,
refinement and grace. It has to do with the coarse boor who defiles
with his person and his speech and the courtly, cultured gentleman
who becomes the exemplar of those who come under his influence. It
touches the depraved gamin of the alley and the celebrated scholar
whose pen and voice shed light and comfort. It concerns itself with
the dark lurking places of the prowlers of the night who prey upon
innocence, virtue, and prosperity and with the cultured home whose
members make and glorify civilization.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Its scope.</span>&mdash;It swings through
the mighty arc, from the anarchist plotting devastation and death
up to Socrates inciting his friends to good courage as he drinks
the hemlock. It takes cognizance of the slave in his cabin no less
than of Lincoln in his act of setting the slaves free. It touches
the extremes in Mrs. Grundy and Clara Barton. It concerns itself
with Medea scattering the limbs of her murdered brother along the
way to delay her pursuers and with Antigone performing the rites of
burial over the body of her brother that his soul <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>267</span>might live
forever. It has to do with Circe, who transformed men into pigs,
and with Frances Willard, who sought to restore lost manhood. It
includes all that pertains to Lucrezia Borgia and Mary Magdalene;
Nero and Phillips Brooks; John Wilkes Booth and Nathan Hale; Becky
Sharp and Evangeline; Goneril and Cordelia; and Benedict Arnold and
George Washington.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Behavior in history.</span>&mdash;Before
the teacher can win a starting-point in her efforts to organize the
activities of her school in such a manner that they may function in
behavior, she must have a pretty clear notion as to what behavior
really is. To gain this comprehensive notion she must review in her
thinking the events that make up history. In the presence of each
one of these events she must realize that this is the behavior in
which antecedent activities functioned. Then she will be free to
speculate upon the character of those activities, what
modifications, accretions, or abrasions they experienced in passing
from the place of their origin to the event before her, and whether
like activities in another place or another age would function in a
similar event. She need not be discouraged if she finds no adequate
answer, for she will be the better teacher because of the
speculation, even lacking a definite answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name=
"page268"></a>268</span><span class=
"paraHead">Machinery.</span>&mdash;She must challenge every piece
of machinery that meets her gaze with the question &ldquo;Whence
camest thou?&rdquo; She knows, in a vague way, that it is the
product of mind, but she needs to know more. She needs to know that
the machine upon which she is looking did not merely happen, but
that it has a history as fascinating as any romance if only she
cause it to give forth a revelation of itself. She may find in
tracing the evolution of the plow that the original was the
forefinger of some cave man, in the remote past. For a certainty,
she will find, lurking in some machine, in some form, the
multiplication table, and this fact will form an interesting nexus
between behavior in the form of the machine and the activities of
the school. She will be delighted to learn that no machine was ever
constructed without the aid of the multiplication table, and when
she is teaching this table thereafter she does the work with keener
zest, knowing that it may function in another machine.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Art.</span>&mdash;When she looks at the
&ldquo;Captive Andromache&rdquo; by Leighton she is involved in a
network of speculations. She wonders by what devious ways the mind
of the artist had traveled in reaching this type and example of
behavior. She wonders whether <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269"
name="page269"></a>269</span>the artistic impulse was born in him
or whether it was acquired. She sees that he knew his Homer and she
would be glad to know just how his reading of the
&ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; had come to function in this particular
picture. She further wonders what lessons in drawing and painting
the artist had had in the schools that finally culminated in this
masterpiece, and whether any of his classmates ever achieved
distinction as artists. She wonders, too, whether there is an
embryo artist in her class and what she ought to do in the face of
that possibility. Again she wonders how geography, grammar, and
spelling can be made to function in such a painting as Rosa
Bonheur&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Plough Oxen,&rdquo; and her wonder
serves to invest these subjects with new meaning and power.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Shakespeare.</span>&mdash;In the school
at Stratford they pointed out to her the desk at which Shakespeare
sat as a lad, with all its boyish hieroglyphics, and her thought
instinctively leaped across the years to &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo;
&ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo; She pondered
deeply the relation between the activities of the lad and the
behavior of the man, wondering how much the school had to do with
the plays that stand alone in literature, and whether he imbibed
the power <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name=
"page270"></a>270</span>from associations, from books, from people,
or from his ancestors. She wondered what magic ingredient had been
dropped into the activities of his life that had proven the
determining factor in the plays that set him apart among men. She
realizes that his behavior was distinctive, and she fain would
discover the talisman whose potent influence determined the bent
and power of his mind. And she wonders, again, whether any pupil in
her school may ever exemplify such behavior.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">History.</span>&mdash;When she reads her
history she has a keener, deeper, and wider interest than ever
before, for she now realizes that every event of history is an
effect, whose inciting causes lie back in the years, and is not
fortuitous as she once imagined. She realizes that the historical
event may have been the convergence of many lines of thinking
emanating from widely divergent sources, and this conception serves
to make her interest more acute. In thus reasoning from effect back
to cause she gains the ability to reason from cause to effect and,
therefore, her teaching of history becomes far more vital. She is
studying the philosophy of history and not a mere catalogue of
isolated and unrelated facts. History is a great web, and in the
events she sees <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name=
"page271"></a>271</span>the pattern that minds have worked. She is
more concerned now with the reactions of her pupils to this pattern
than she is with mere names and dates, for these reactions give her
a clew to tendencies on the part of her pupils that may lead to
results of vast import.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Poetry.</span>&mdash;In every poem she
reads she finds an illustration of mental and spiritual behavior,
and she fain would find the key that will discover the mental
operations that conditioned the form of the poem. She would hark
back to the primal impulse of each bit of imagery, and she analyzes
and appraises each word and line with the zeal and skill of a
connoisseur. She would estimate justly and accurately the
activities that functioned in this sort of behavior. She seeks for
the influences of landscapes, of sky, of birds, of sunsets, of
clouds,&mdash;in short, of all nature, as well as of the
manifestations of the human soul. Thus the teacher gains access
into the very heart of nature and life and can thus cause the poem
to become a living thing to her pupils. In all literature she is
ever seeking for the inciting causes; for only so can she prove an
inspiring guide and counselor in pointing to them the way toward
worthy achievements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name=
"page272"></a>272</span><span class="paraHead">Attitude of
teacher.</span>&mdash;In conclusion, then, we may readily
distinguish the vitalized teacher from the traditional teacher by
her attitude toward the facts set down in the books. The
traditional teacher looks upon them as mere facts to be noted,
connoted, memorized, reproduced, and graded, whereas the vitalized
teacher regards them as types of behavior, as ultimate effects of
mental and spiritual activities. The traditional teacher knows that
seven times nine are sixty-three, and that is quite enough for her
purpose. If the pupil recites the fact correctly, she gives him a
perfect grade and recommends him for promotion. For the vitalized
teacher the bare fact is not enough. She does not disdain or
neglect the mechanics of her work, but she sees beyond the present.
She sees this same fact merging into the operations of algebra,
geometry, trigonometry, calculus, physics, and engineering, until
it finally functions in some enterprise that redounds to the
well-being of humanity.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;To her every
event of history, every fact of mathematics and science, every line
of poetry, every passage of literature is pregnant with meaning,
dynamic, vibrant, dramatic, and prophetic. Nothing can be dull or
prosaic to her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name=
"page273"></a>273</span>electric touch. All the facts of the books,
all the emotions of life, and all the beauties of nature she weaves
into the fabric of her dreams for her pupils. The goal of her
aspirations is far ahead, and around this goal she sees clustered
those who were her pupils. In every recitation this goal looms
large in her vision. She can envisage the viewpoint of her pupils,
and thus strives to have them envisage hers. She yearns to have
them join with her in looking down through the years when the
activities of the school will be functioning in worthy
behavior.</p>

<h3>BOND AND FREE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Spiritual freedom.</span>&mdash;There is
no slavery more abject than the bondage of ignorance. John Bunyan
was not greatly inconvenienced by being incarcerated in jail. His
spirit could not be imprisoned, but the imprisonment of his body
gave his mind and spirit freedom and opportunity to do work that,
otherwise, might not have been done. If he had lived a mere
physical life and had had no resources of the mind upon which to
draw, his experience in the jail would have been most irksome. But,
being equipped with mental and spiritual resources, he could smile
disdain at prison bars, and proceed with his work in spiritual
freedom. Had he been dependent solely, or even mainly, upon food,
sleep, drink, and other contributions to his physical being for his
definition of life, then his whole life would have been restricted
to the limits of his cell; but the more extensive and expansive
resources of his life rendered the jail virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name=
"page276"></a>276</span> <span class=
"paraHead">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;It is possible, therefore,
so to furnish the mind that it can enjoy freedom in spite of any
bondage to which the body may be subjected. Indeed, the whole
process of education has as its large objective the freedom of the
mind and spirit. Knowledge of truth gives freedom; ignorance of
truth is bondage. A man&rsquo;s knowledge may be measured by the
extent of his freedom; his ignorance, by the extent of his bondage.
In the presence of truth the man who knows stands free and
unabashed, while the man who does not know stands baffled and
embarrassed. In a chemical laboratory the man who knows chemistry
moves about with ease and freedom, while the man who does not know
chemistry stands fixed in one spot, fearing to move lest he may
cause an explosion. To the man who knows astronomy the sky at night
presents a marvelous panorama full of interest and inspiration, to
the man who is ignorant of astronomy the same sky is merely a dome
studded with dots of light.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Rome.</span>&mdash;The man who lacks
knowledge of history is utterly bewildered and ill at ease in the
Capitoline Museum at Rome. All about him are busts that represent
the men who made Roman history, but they have no meaning for him.
Nero <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name=
"page277"></a>277</span>and Julius C&aelig;sar are mere names to
him and, as such, bear no relation to life. Cicero and Caligula
might exchange places and it would be all one to him. He takes a
fleeting glance at the statue of the Dying Gaul, but it conveys no
meaning to him. He has neither read nor heard of Byron&rsquo;s poem
which this statue inspired. He sees near by the celebrated Marble
Faun, but he has not read Hawthorne&rsquo;s romance and therefore
the statue evokes no interest. In short, he is bored and
uncomfortable, and importunes his companions to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>When he looks out upon the Forum he says it looks the same to
him as any other stone quarry, and he roundly berates the
shiftlessness of the Romans in permitting the Coliseum to remain
when the stone could be used for building purposes, for bridges,
and for paving. The Tiber impresses him not at all for, as he says,
he has seen much larger rivers and, certainly, many whose water is
more clear. In the Sistine Chapel he cannot be persuaded to give
more than a passing glance at the ceiling because it makes his neck
ache to look up. The Laoco&ouml;n and Apollo Belvedere he will not
see, giving as a reason that he is more than tired of looking at
silly statuary. He feels it an imposition that he should be dragged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name=
"page278"></a>278</span>around to such places when he cares nothing
for them. His evident boredom is pathetic, and he repeatedly says
that he&rsquo;d far rather be visiting in the corner grocery back
home, than to be spending his time in the Vatican.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Contrasts.</span>&mdash;In this, he
speaks but the simple truth. In the grocery he has comfort while,
in the Vatican, he is in bondage. His ignorance of art,
architecture, history, and literature reduces him to thralldom in
any place that exemplifies these. In the grocery he has comfort
because he can have a share in the small talk and gossip that
obtain there. His companions speak his language and he feels
himself to be one of them. Were they, by any chance, to begin a
discussion of history he would feel himself ostracized and would
leave them to their own devices. If they would retain him as a
companion they must keep within his range of interests and
thinking. To go outside his small circle is to offer an affront. He
cannot speak the language of history, or science, or art, and so
experiences a feeling of discomfort in any presence where this
language is spoken.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">History.</span>&mdash;In this concrete
illustration we find ample justification for the teaching of
history in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name=
"page279"></a>279</span>schools. History is one of the large
strands in the web of life, and to neglect this study is to deny to
the pupil one of the elements of freedom. It is not easy to
conceive a situation that lacks the element of history in one or
another of its phases or manifestations. Whether the pupil travels,
or embarks upon a professional life, or associates, in any
relation, with cultivated people, he will find a knowledge of
history not only a convenience but a real necessity, if he is to
escape the feeling of thralldom. The utilitarian value of school
studies has been much exploited, and that phase is not to be
neglected; but we need to go further in estimating the influence of
any study. We need to inquire not only how a knowledge of the study
will aid the pupil in his work, but also how it will contribute to
his life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Restricted concepts.</span>&mdash;We
lustily proclaim our country to be the land of the free, but our
notion of freedom is much restricted. In the popular conception
freedom has reference to the body. A man can walk the streets
without molestation and can vote his sentiments at the polls, but
he may not be able to take a day&rsquo;s ride about Concord and
Lexington with any appreciable sense of freedom. He may walk about
the Congressional Library and feel <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page280" name="page280"></a>280</span>himself in prison. He may
desert a lecture for the saloon in the interests of his own
comfort. He may find the livery stable more congenial than the
drawing-room. His body may experience a sort of freedom while his
mind and spirit are held fast in the shackles of ignorance. A
Burroughs, an Edison, a Thoreau, might have his feet in the stocks
and still have more freedom than such a man as this. He walks about
amid historic scenes with his spiritual eyes blindfolded, and that
condition of mind precludes freedom.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Real freedom.</span>&mdash;We shall not
attain our high privileges as a free people until freedom comes to
mean more than the absence of physical restraint. Our conception of
freedom must reach out into the world of mind and spirit, and our
educational processes must esteem it their chief function to set
mental and spiritual prisoners free. We have only to read history,
science, and literature to realize what sublime heights mind can
attain in its explorations of the realms of truth, and, since the
boys and girls of our schools are to pass this way but once, every
effort possible should be made to accord to them full freedom to
emulate the mental achievements of those who have gone before. They
have a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name=
"page281"></a>281</span>right to become the equals of their
predecessors, and only freedom of mind and spirit can make them
such. Every man should be larger than his task, and only freedom of
mind and spirit can make him so. The man who works in the ditch can
revel among the sublime manifestations of truth if only his mind is
rightly furnished.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Spelling.</span>&mdash;The man who is
deficient in spelling inevitably confines his vocabulary to narrow
limits and so lacks facility of expression and nicety of diction.
Accordingly, he suffers by comparison with others whose vocabulary
is more extensive and whose diction is, therefore, more elegant.
The consciousness of his shortcomings restricts the exuberance of
his life, and he fails of that sense of large freedom that a
knowledge of spelling would certainly give. So that even in such an
elementary study as spelling the school has an opportunity to
generate in the pupils a feeling of freedom, and this feeling is
quite as important in the scheme of life as the ability to spell
correctly. In this statement, there is no straining for effects. On
the contrary, many illustrations might be adduced to prove that it
is but a plain statement of fact. A cultured lady confesses that
she is thrown into a panic whenever <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page282" name="page282"></a>282</span>she has occasion to use the
word <em>Tuesday</em> because she is never certain of the
spelling.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The switchboard.</span>&mdash;Life may be
likened to an extensive electric switchboard, and only that man or
woman has complete freedom who can press the right button without
hesitation or trepidation. The ignorant man stands paralyzed in the
presence of this mystery and knows not how to proceed to evoke the
correct response to his desires. It has been said that everything
is infinitely high that we cannot see over. Hence, to the man who
does not know, cube root is infinitely high and, as such, is as far
away from his comprehension as the fourth dimension or the
precession of the equinoxes. In the presence of even such a simple
truth as cube root he stands helpless and enthralled. He lives in a
small circle and cannot know the joy of the man whose mind
forgathers with the big truths of life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Comparisons.</span>&mdash;The ignorant
man cannot accompany this man upon his mighty excursions, but must
remain behind to make what he can of his feeble resources. The one
can penetrate the mysteries of the planets and bring back their
secrets; the other must confine his thinking to the weather and the
crops. The one can find entertainment in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>283</span>the Bible
and Shakespeare; the other seeks companionship among the cowboys
and Indians of the picture-films. The one sits in rapt delight
through an evening of grand opera, reveling on the sunlit summits
of harmony; the other can rise no higher in the scale of music than
the raucous hand organ. The one finds keen delight among the
masterpieces of art; the other finds his definition of art in the
colored supplement. The one experiences the acme of pleasure in
communing with historians, musicians, artists, scientists, and
philologists; the other finds such associations the very acme of
boredom. The one finds freedom among the big things of life; the
other finds galling bondage.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Three elements of
freedom.</span>&mdash;There are three elements of freedom that are
worthy of emphasis. These are self-reliance, self-support, and
self-respect. These elements are the trinity that constitute one of
the major ultimate aims of the vitalized school. The school that
inculcates these qualities must prove a vital force in the life of
the pupil; and the pupil who wins these qualities is well equipped
for the work of real living. These qualities are the golden
gateways to freedom, nor can there be a full measure of freedom if
either of these qualities <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284"
name="page284"></a>284</span>be lacking. Moreover, these qualities
are cumulative in their relations to one another. Self-reliance
leads to and engenders self-support, and both these underlie and
condition self-respect. Or, to put the case conversely, there
cannot be self-respect in the absence of self-reliance and
self-support.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Self-reliance.</span>&mdash;It would not
be easy to over-magnify the influence of the school that is rightly
conducted in the way of inculcating the quality of self-reliance
and in causing it to grow into a habit. Every problem that the boy
solves by his own efforts, every obstacle that he surmounts, every
failure that he transforms into a success, and every advance he
makes towards mastery gives him a greater degree of self-reliance,
greater confidence in his powers, and greater courage to persevere.
It is the high privilege of the teacher to cause a boy to believe
in himself, to have confidence in his ability to win through. To
this end, she adds gradually to the difficulties of his work,
always keeping inside the limits of discouragement, and never fails
to give recognition to successful achievements. In this way the boy
gains self-reliance and so plumes himself for still loftier
flights. Day after day he moves upward and onward, until at length
he exemplifies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name=
"page285"></a>285</span>the sentiment of Virgil, &ldquo;They can
because they think they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">This quality in
practice.</span>&mdash;The self-reliance that becomes ingrained in
a boy&rsquo;s habits of life will not evaporate in the heat of the
activities and competition of the after-school life. On the
contrary, it will be re&euml;nforced and crystallized by the
opportunities of business or professional life, and, in calm
reliance upon his own powers, he will welcome competition as an
opportunity to put himself to the test. He is no weakling, for in
school he made his independent way in spite of the lions in his
path, and so gained fiber and courage for the contests of daily
life. And because he has industry, thrift, perseverance, and
self-reliance the gates of success swing wide open and he enters
into the heritage which he himself has won.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The sterling man.</span>&mdash;His career
offers an emphatic negation to the notion that obtains here and
there to the effect that education makes a boy weak and
ineffective, robbing him of the quality of sterling elemental
manhood, and fitting him only for the dance-hall and inane social
functions. The man who is rightly trained has resources that enable
him to add dignity and character to social functions in that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name=
"page286"></a>286</span>he exhales power and bigness. People
recognize in him a real man, capable, alert, and potential, and
gladly pay him the silent tribute that manhood never fails to win.
He can hold his own among the best, and only the best appeal to
him.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Self-respect.</span>&mdash;And, just as
he wins the respect of others, so he wins the respect of himself,
and so the triumvirate of virtues is complete. Having achieved
self-respect he disdains the cheap, the bizarre, the gaudy, and the
superficial. He knows that there are real values in life that are
worthy of his powers and best efforts, and these real values are
the goal of his endeavors. Moreover, he has achieved freedom, and
so is not fettered by precedent, convention, or fads. He is free to
establish precedents, to violate the conventions when a great
principle is at stake, and to ignore fads. He can stand unabashed
in the presence of the learned of the earth, and can understand the
heartbeats of life, because he has had experience both of learning
and of life. And being a free man his life is fuller and richer,
and he knows when and how to bestow the help that will give to
others a sense of freedom and make life for them a greater
boon.</p>

<h3>EXAMINATIONS</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Prelude.</span>&mdash;When the vitalized
school has finally been achieved there will result a radical
departure from the present procedure in the matter of examinations.
A teacher in the act of preparing a list of examination questions
of the traditional type is not an edifying spectacle. He has a
text-book open before him from which he extracts nuts for his
pupils to crack. It is a purely mechanical process and only a
mechanician could possibly debase intelligence and manhood to such
unworthy uses. Were it not so pathetic it would excite laughter.
But this teacher is the victim of tradition. He knows no other way.
He made out examination questions in accordance with this plan
fifteen years ago and the heavens didn&rsquo;t fall; then why,
pray, change the method? Besides, men and women who were thus
examined when they were children in school have achieved
distinction in the world&rsquo;s affairs, and that, of itself,
proves the validity of the method, according to his way of
thinking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name=
"page289"></a>289</span> <span class="paraHead">Mental
atrophy.</span>&mdash;It seems never to occur to him that children
have large powers of resistance and that some of his pupils may
have won distinction in spite of his teaching and his methods of
examination and not because of them. His trouble is mental and
spiritual atrophy. He thinks and feels by rule of thumb,
&ldquo;without variableness or shadow of turning.&rdquo; In the
matter of new methods he is quite immune. He settled things to his
complete satisfaction years ago, and what was good enough for his
father, in school methods, is quite good enough for him. His
self-satisfaction would approach sublimity, were it not so
extremely ludicrous. He has a supercilious sneer for innovations.
How he can bring himself to make concessions to modernity to the
extent of riding in an automobile is one of the mysteries.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Self-complacency.</span>&mdash;His
complacency would excite profound admiration did it not betoken
deadline inaction. He became becalmed on the sea of life years ago,
but does not know it. When the procession of life moves past him he
thinks he is the one who is in motion, and takes great unction to
himself for his progressiveness&mdash;&ldquo;and not a wave of
trouble rolls across his peaceful breast.&rdquo; So <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>290</span>he proceeds
to copy another question from the text-book, solemnly writing it on
a bit of paper, and later copying on the blackboard with such a
show of bravery and gusto as would indicate that some great truth
had been revealed to him alone. In an orotund voice he declaims to
his pupils the mighty revelations that he copied from the book. His
examination r&eacute;gime is the old offer of a mess of pottage for
a birthright.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Remembering and knowing.</span>&mdash;In
our school practices we have become so inured to the
question-and-answer method of the recitation that we have made the
examination its counterpart. As teachers we are constantly
admonishing our pupils to remember, as if that were the basic
principle in the educational process. In reality we do not want
them to remember&mdash;we want them to know; and the distinction is
all-important. The child does not remember which is his right hand;
he knows. He does not remember the face of his mother; he knows
her. He does not remember which is the sun and which is the moon;
he knows. He does not remember snow, and rain, and ice, and mud; he
knows.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Questions and answers.</span>&mdash;But,
none the less, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name=
"page291"></a>291</span>we proceed upon the agreeable assumption
that education is the process of memorizing, and so reduce our
pupils to the plane of parrots; for a parrot has a prodigious
memory. Hence, it comes to pass that, in the so-called preparation
of their lessons, the pupils con the words of the book, again and
again, and when they can repeat the words of the book we smile
approval and give a perfect grade. It matters not at all that they
display no intelligent understanding of the subject so long as they
can repeat the statements of the book. It never seems to occur to
the teacher that the pupil of the third grade might give the words
of the binomial theorem without the slightest apprehension of its
meaning. We grade for the repetition of words, not for
intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Court procedure.</span>&mdash;In our
school practices we seem to take our cue from court procedure and
make each pupil who recites feel that he is on the witness stand
experiencing all its attendant discomforts, instead of being a
co&ouml;perating agent in an agreeable enterprise. We suspend the
sword of Damocles above his head and demand from him such answers
as will fill the measure of our preconceived notions. He may know
more of the subject, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name=
"page292"></a>292</span>in reality, than the teacher, but this will
not avail. In fact, this may militate against him. She demands to
know what the book says, with small concern for his own knowledge
of the subject. We proclaim loudly that we must encourage the open
mind, and then by our witness-stand ordeal forestall the
possibility of open-mindedness.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Rational methods.</span>&mdash;When we
have learned wisdom enough, and humanity enough, and pedagogy
enough to dispense with the quasi-inquisition type of recitation,
the transition to a more rational method of examination will be
well-nigh automatic. Let it not be inferred that to inveigh against
the question-and-answer type of recitation is to advocate any
abatement of thoroughness. On the contrary, the thought is to
insure greater thoroughness, and to make evident the patent truth
that thoroughness and agreeableness are not incompatible.
Experience ought to teach us that we find it no hardship to work
with supreme intensity at any task that lures us; and, in that
respect, we are but grown-up children. We have only to generate a
white-heat of interest in order to have our pupils work with
intensity. But this sort of interest does not thrive under
compulsion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name=
"page293"></a>293</span> <span class="paraHead">Analysis and
synthesis.</span>&mdash;The question-and-answer method evermore
implies analysis. But children are inclined to synthesis, which
shows at once that the analytic method runs counter to their
natural bent. They like to make things, to put things together, to
experiment along the lines of synthesis. Hence the industrial arts
appeal to them. But constructing problems satisfies their
inclination to synthesis quite as well as constructing coat-hangers
or culinary compounds, if only the incitement is rational. The
writers of our text-books are coming to recognize this fact, and it
does them credit. In time, we may hope to have books that will take
into account the child&rsquo;s natural inclinations, and the
schools will be the beneficiaries.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Thinking.</span>&mdash;In the process of
synthesis the pupil is free to draw upon the entire stock of his
accumulated resources, whereas in the question-and-answer method he
is circumscribed. In the question-and-answer plan he is encouraged
to remember; in the other he is encouraged to think. In our
theories we exalt thinking to the highest pinnacle, but in our
practice we repress thinking and exalt memory. We admonish our
pupils to think, sometimes with a degree of emphasis that weakens
our admonition, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name=
"page294"></a>294</span>and then bestow our laurel wreaths upon
those who think little but remember much. Our inconsistency in this
respect would be amusing if the child&rsquo;s interests could be
ignored. But seeing that the child pays the penalty, our
inconsistency is inexcusable.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Penalizing.</span>&mdash;The
question-and-answer r&eacute;gime, in its full application, is not
wholly unlike a punitive expedition, in that the teacher asks the
question and sits with pencil poised in air ready to blacklist the
unfortunate pupil whose memory fails him for the moment. The child
is embarrassed, if not panic-stricken, and the teacher seems more
like an avenging nemesis than a friend and helper. Just when he
needs help he receives epithets and a condemning zero. He sinks
into himself, disgusted and outraged, and becomes wholly
indifferent to the subsequent phases of the lesson. He feels that
he has been trapped and betrayed, and days are required for his
redemption from discouragement.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Traditional method.</span>&mdash;In the
school where this method is in vogue the examination takes on the
color and character of the recitation. At the close of the term, or
semester, the teacher makes out the proverbial ten questions which
very often reflect her own bias, or predilections, and in these ten
questions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name=
"page295"></a>295</span>are the issues of life and death. A hundred
questions might be asked upon the subjects upon which the pupils
are to be tested, but these ten are the only ones
offered&mdash;with no options. Then the grading of the papers
ensues, and, in this ordeal, the teacher thinks herself another
Atlas carrying the world upon her shoulders. The boy who receives
sixty-seven and the one who receives twenty-seven are both banished
into outer darkness without recourse. The teacher may know that the
former boy is able to do the work of the next grade, but the marks
she has made on the paper are sacred things, and he has fallen
below the requisite seventy. Hence, he is banished to the limbo of
the lost, for she is the supreme arbiter of his fate.</p>
<p>No allowance is made for nervousness, illness, or temperamental
conditions, but the same measuring-rod is applied to all with no
discrimination, and she has the marks on the papers to prove her
infallibility. If a pupil should dare to question the correctness
of her grades, he would be punished or penalized for impertinence.
Her grades are oracular, inviolable, and therefore not subject to
review. She may have been quite able to grade the pupils justly
without any such ordeal, but the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page296" name="page296"></a>296</span>school has the examination
habit, and all the sacred rites must be observed. In that school
there is but one way of salvation, and that way is not subject
either to repeal or amendment. It is <i>via sacra</i> and must not
be profaned. Time and long usage have set the seal of their
approval upon it and woe betide the vandal who would dare tamper
with it.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Testing for
intelligence.</span>&mdash;This emphatic, albeit true,
representation of the type of examinations that still obtains in
some schools has been set out thus in some detail that we may have
a basis of comparison with the other type of examinations that
tests for intelligence rather than for memory. For children, not
unlike their elders, are glad to have people proceed upon the
assumption that they are endowed with a modicum of intelligence.
They will strive earnestly to meet the expectations of their
parents and teachers. Many wise mothers and teachers have incited
children to their best efforts by giving them to know that much is
expected of them. It is always far better to expect rather than to
demand. Coercion may be necessary at times, but coercion frowns
while expectation smiles. Hence, in every school exercise the
teacher does well to concede to the pupils a reasonable degree of
intelligence and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name=
"page297"></a>297</span>then let her expectations be commensurate
with their intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Concessions.</span>&mdash;It is an
affront to the intelligence of a child not to concede that he knows
that the days are longer in the summer than in winter. We may fully
expect such a degree of intelligence, and base our teaching upon
this assumption. In our examinations we pay a delicate compliment
to the child by giving him occasion for thinking. We may ask him
why the days are longer in summer than in winter and thus give him
the feeling that we respect his intelligence. Our examinations may
always assume observed facts. Even if he has never noted the fact
that his shadow is shorter in summer than in winter, if we assume
such knowledge on his part and ask him why such is the case, we
shall stimulate his powers of observation along with his thinking.
If the teacher asks a boy when and by whom America was discovered,
he resents the implication of crass ignorance; but if she asks how
Columbus came to discover America in 1492, he feels that it is
conceded that there are some things he knows.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;If we ask for
the width of the zones, we are placing the emphasis upon memory;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name=
"page298"></a>298</span>but, if we ask them to account for the
width of the zones, we are assuming some knowledge and are testing
for intelligent thinking. If we ask why the sun rises in the east
and sets in the west we are, once again, assuming a knowledge of
the facts and testing for intelligence. If we ask for the location
of the Suez, Kiel, and Welland canals, we are testing for mere
memory; but, if we ask what useful purpose these canals serve, we
are testing for intelligence. When we ask pupils to give the rule
for division of fractions, we are testing again for mere memory;
but when we ask why we invert the terms of the divisor, we are
treating our pupils as rational beings. Our pedagogical sins bulk
large in geography when we continually ask pupils to locate places
that have no interest for them. Such teaching is a travesty on
pedagogy and a sin against childhood.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Intelligence of teacher.</span>&mdash;If
the teacher is consulting her own ease and comfort, then she will
conduct the examination as a test for memory. It requires but
little work and less thinking to formulate a set of examination
questions on this basis. She has only to turn the pages of the
text-book and make a check-mark here and there till she has
accumulated ten questions, and the trick is done. <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>299</span>But if she
is testing for intelligence, the matter is not so simple. To test
for intelligence requires intelligence and a careful thinking over
the whole scope of the subject under consideration. To do this
effectively the teacher must keep within the range of the
pupil&rsquo;s powers and still stimulate him to his best
efforts.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Major and minor.</span>&mdash;She must
distinguish between major and minor, and this is no slight task.
Her own bias may tend to elevate a minor into a major rank, and
this disturbs the balance. Again, she must see things in their
right relations and proportions, and this requires deliberate
thinking. In &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo; she may regard the Fool as a
negligible minor, but some pupil may have discovered that
Shakespeare intended this character to serve a great dramatic
purpose, and the teacher suffers humiliation before her class. If
she were testing for memory, she would ask the class to name ten
characters of the play and like hackneyed questions, so that her
own intelligence would not be put to the test. Accurate scholarship
and broad general intelligence may be combined in the same person
and, certainly, we are striving to inculcate and foster these
qualities in our pupils.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name=
"page300"></a>300</span><span class="paraHead">Books of questions
and answers.</span>&mdash;When the examinations for teachers shall
become tests for intelligence and not for memory, we may fully
expect to find the same principle filtering into our school
practices. It is a sad travesty upon education that teachers, even
in this enlightened age, still try to prepare for examinations by
committing to memory questions and answers from some book or
educational paper. But the fault lies not so much with the teachers
themselves as with those who prepare the questions. The teachers
have been led to believe that to be able to recall memorized facts
is education. There are those, of course, who will commercialize
this misconception of education by publishing books of questions
and answers. Of course weak teachers will purchase these books,
thinking them a passport into the promised land.</p>
<p>The reform must come at the source of the questions that
constitute the examination. When examiners have grown broad enough
in their conception of education to construct questions that will
test for intelligence, we shall soon be rid of such an incubus upon
educational progress as a book of questions and answers. The field
is wide and alluring. History, literature, the sciences, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name=
"page301"></a>301</span>languages are rich in material that can be
used in testing for intelligence, and we need not resort to petty
chit-chat in preparing for examinations.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The way of reform.</span>&mdash;We must
take this broader view of the whole subject of examinations before
we can hope to emerge from our beclouded and restricted conceptions
of education. And it can be done, as we know from the fact that it
is being done. Here and there we find superintendents, principals,
and teachers who are shuddering away from the question-and-answer
method both in the recitation and in the examination. They have
outgrown the swaddling-clothes and have risen to the estate of
broad-minded, intelligent manhood and womanhood. They have enlarged
their concept of education and have become too generous in their
impulses to subject either teachers or pupils to an ordeal that is
a drag upon their mental and spiritual freedom.</p>

<h3>WORLD-BUILDING</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">An outline.</span>&mdash;Education is the
process of world-building. Every man builds his own world and is
confined, throughout life, to the world which he himself builds. He
cannot build for another, nor can another build for him. Neither
can there be an exchange of worlds. Moreover, the process of
building continues to the end of life. In building their respective
worlds all men have access to the same materials, and the character
of each man&rsquo;s world, then, is conditioned by his choice and
use of these materials. If one man elects to build a small world
for himself, he will find, at hand, an abundant supply of petty
materials that he is free to use in its construction. But, if he
elects to build a large world, the big things of life are his to
use. If he chooses to spend his life in an ugly world, he will find
ample materials for his purpose. If, however, he prefers a
beautiful world, the materials will not be lacking, and he will
have the joy and inspiration <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304"
name="page304"></a>304</span>that come from spending a lifetime
amid things that are fraught with beauty.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Exemplifications.</span>&mdash;This
conception of education is not a figment of fancy but a reality
whose verification can be attested by a thousand examples. We have
only to look about us to see people who are living among things
that are unbeautiful and who might be living in beautiful worlds
had they elected to do so. Others are spending their lives among
things that are trivial and inconsequential, apparently blind to
the great and significant things that lie all about them. Some
build their worlds with the minor materials, while others select
the majors. Some select the husks, while others choose the grain.
Some build their worlds from the materials that others disdain and
seem not to realize the inferiority of their worlds as compared
with others. Their supreme complacency in the midst of the ugliness
or pettiness of their worlds seems to accentuate the conclusion
that they have not been able to see, or else have not been able to
use, the other materials that are available.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Flowers.</span>&mdash;To the man who
would live in a beautiful world flowers will be a necessity. To
such a man life would be robbed of some of its charm if his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name=
"page305"></a>305</span>world should lack flowers. But unless he
has subjective flowers he cannot have objective ones. He must have
a sensory foundation that will react to flowers or there can be no
flowers in his world. There may be flowers upon his breakfast
table, but unless he has a sensory foundation that will react to
them they will be nonexistent to him. He can react to the bacon,
eggs, and potatoes, but not to the flowers, unless he has
cultivated flowers in his spirit before coming to the table.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Lily-of-the-valley
civilization.</span>&mdash;All the flowers that grow may adorn his
world if he so elects. He may be content with dandelions and
sunflowers if he so wills, or he may reach forth and gather about
him for his delight the entire gamut of roses from the Maryland to
the American Beauty, the violet and its college-bred descendant the
pansy, the heliotrope, the gladiolus, the carnation, the primrose,
the chrysanthemum, the sweet pea, the aster, and the orchid. But,
if he can reach the high plane of the lily-of-the-valley, in all
its daintiness, delicacy, chastity, and fragrance, he will have
achieved distinction. When society shall have attained to the
lily-of-the-valley plane, life will be fine, fragrant, and
beautiful. Intemperance will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306"
name="page306"></a>306</span>be no more, and profanity, vulgarity,
and coarseness will disappear. Such things cannot thrive in a
lily-of-the-valley world, but shrink away from the presence of
beauty and purity.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Music.</span>&mdash;Again, the man who is
building such a world will elect to have music as one of the
elements. But here, again, we find that he must have a sensory
foundation or there will be no music for him. Moreover, the nature
of this sensory foundation will determine the character of the
music to be found in his world. He may be satisfied with
&ldquo;Tipperary&rdquo; or he may yearn for Handel, Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, Melba, and Schumann-Heink. He may not be able to rise
above the plane of ragtime, or he may attain to the sublime plane
of &ldquo;The Dead March in Saul.&rdquo; He has access to all the
music from the discordant hand organ to the oratorio and grand
opera. In his introduction of a concert company, the chairman said:
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, the artists who are to favor us this
evening will render nothing but high-grade selections. If any of
you are inclined to be critical and to say that their music is
above your heads, I beg to remind you that it will not be above the
place where your heads ought to be.&rdquo; In substance he was
saying that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name=
"page307"></a>307</span>nature of the music depended not so much
upon the singers as upon the sensory foundation of the
auditors.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Music and life.</span>&mdash;Having a
sensory foundation capable of reacting to the best music, this man
opens wide the portals of his world for the reception of the
orchestra, the concert, the opera, and the choir, and his spirit
revels in the &ldquo;concord of sweet sounds.&rdquo; Through the
toil of the day he anticipates the music of the evening, and the
next day he goes to his work buoyant and rejuvenated by reason of
the musical refreshment. He has music in anticipation and music in
retrospect, and thus his world is regaled with harmony. His world
cannot be a dead level or a desert, for it is diversified by the
alluring undulations of music and made fertile by the perennial
fountains of inspiring harmony, and his world</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">&ldquo;shall be filled with music</p>
<p>And the cares that infest the day</p>
<p>Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,</p>
<p>And as silently steal away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="paraHead">Children.</span>&mdash;Again, this man
elects to have children in his world, for he has come to know that
there is no sweeter music on earth than the laughter <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>308</span>of a child.
Were he sojourning five hundred miles away from the abode of
children he would soon be glad to walk the entire distance that he
might again hear the prattle, the laughter, or even the crying of a
child. Cowboys on the plains have been thrown into a frenzy of
delight at the sight of a little child. Full well the man knows
that, if he would have children in his world, he must find these
children for himself; for this task may not be delegated. If he
would bring Paul and Florence Dombey into his world, he must win
them to himself by living with them throughout all the pages of the
book. In order to lure Pollyanna into his world to imbue it with
the spirit of gladness, he must establish a community of interests
with her by imbibing her spirit as revealed in the book.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Characterizations.</span>&mdash;He may
not have Little Joe in his world unless his spirit becomes attuned
to the pathos of <i>Bleak House</i>. And he both wants and needs
Little Joe. Echoing and re&euml;choing through his soul each day
are the words of the little chap, &ldquo;He wuz good to me, he
wuz,&rdquo; and acting vicariously for the little fellow he touches
the lives of other unfortunates as the hours go by and brings to
them sunshine and hope and courage. And he <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>309</span>must needs
have Tiny Tim, also, to banish the cobwebs from his soul with his
fervent &ldquo;God bless us every one.&rdquo; The day cannot go far
wrong with this simple prayer clinging in his memory. It permeates
the perplexities of the day, gives resiliency to his spirit, and
encourages and re&euml;nforces all the noble impulses that come
into his consciousness. Wherever he goes and whatever he is doing
he feels that Tiny Tim is present to bestow his childish
benediction.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Lessons from childhood.</span>&mdash;In
<i>Laddie</i> he finds a whole family of children to his liking and
feels that his world is the better for their presence. To <i>Old
Curiosity Shop</i> and <i>Silas Marner</i> he goes and brings
thence Little Nell and Eppie, feeling that in their boon
companionship they will make his world more attractive to himself
and others by their gentle graces of kindness and helpfulness. In
his quest for children of the right sort he lingers long with
Dickens, the apostle and benefactor of childhood, but passes by the
colored supplement. For all the children in his world he would have
the approval and blessing of the Master. He would know, when he
hears the words &ldquo;Except ye become as little children,&rdquo;
that reference is made to such children <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>310</span>as he has
about him. At the feet of these children he sits and learns the
lessons of sincerity, guilelessness, simplicity, and faith, and
through their eyes he sees life glorified.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Stars</span>.&mdash;Nor must his world
lack stars. He needs these to draw his thoughts away from sordid
things out into the far spaces. He would not spend a lifetime
thinking of nothing beyond the weather, the ball-score, his
clothes, and his ailments. He wants to think big thoughts, and he
would have stars to guide him. He knows that a man is as high, as
broad, and as deep as his thoughts, and that if he would grow big
in his thinking he must have big objects to engage his thoughts. He
would explore the infinite spaces, commune with the planets in
their courses, attain the sublime heights where the masters have
wrought, and discover, if possible, the sources of power, genius,
and inspiration. He would find delight in the colors of the
rainbow, the glory of the morning, and the iridescence of the
dewdrop. He would train his thoughts to scan the spaces behind the
clouds, to transcend the snow-capped mountain, and to penetrate the
depths of the sea. He would visualize creation, evolution, and the
intricate processes of life. So he must have stars in his
world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name=
"page311"></a>311</span><span class=
"paraHead">Books.</span>&mdash;In addition to all these he must
have books in his world, and he is cognizant of the fact that his
neighbors judge both himself and his world by the character of the
books he selects. He may select <i>Mrs. Wiggs</i> or <i>Les
Miserables</i>. If he elects to have about him books of the cabbage
patch variety, he condemns himself to that sort of reading for a
whole lifetime. Nor is any redemption possible from such standards
save by his own efforts. Neither men nor angels can draw him up to
the plane of Victor Hugo if he elects to abide in the cabbage
patch. If he prefers <i>Graustark</i> to <i>Macbeth</i>, all
people, including his dearest friends, will go on their way and
leave him to his choice. If he says he cannot read Shakespeare,
Massinger, Milton, or Wordsworth, he does no violence to the
reputation of these writers, but merely defines and classifies
himself.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Authors as
companions.</span>&mdash;Having learned or sensed these
distinctions, he elects to consort with Burns, Keats, Shelley,
Southey, Homer, Dante, Virgil, Hawthorne, Scott, Maupassant,
Goethe, Schiller, and George Eliot. In such society he never has
occasion to explain or apologize for his companions. He reads their
books in the open and gains a feeling of elation and exaltation.
When he would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name=
"page312"></a>312</span>see life in the large, he sits before the
picture of Jean Valjean. When he would see integrity and fidelity
in spite of suffering, he sits before the portrait of Job. When he
would see men of heroic size, he has the characters of Homer file
by. If he would see the panorama of the emotions of the human soul,
he selects Hugo as his guide. If he would laugh, he reads <i>Tam
O&rsquo;Shanter</i>; if he would weep, he reads of the death of
Little Nell. If he would see real heroism, he follows Sidney Carton
to the scaffold, or Esther into the presence of the King. He goes
to Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Skylark</i> to find beauty, Burns&rsquo;s
<i>Highland Mary</i> to find tenderness, Hawthorne&rsquo;s
<i>Scarlet Letter</i> to find tragedy, and the <i>Book of Job</i>
to find sublimity. Through his books he comes to know Quasimodo and
Sir Galahad; Becky Sharp and Penelope; Aaron Burr and Enoch Arden;
and Herodias and Florence Nightingale.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">People.</span>&mdash;But his world would
be incomplete without people, and here, again, he is free to
choose. And, since he wants people in his world who will be
constant reminders to him of qualities that he himself would
cultivate, he selects Ruth and Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter to
represent fidelity. When temptation assails him he finds them ready
to lead him back <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name=
"page313"></a>313</span>and up to the plane of high resolves. To
remind him of indomitable courage and perseverance he selects
William the Silent, Christopher Columbus, and Moses. When his
courage is waning and he is becoming flaccid and indolent, their
very presence is a rebuke, and a survey of their achievements
restores him to himself. As examples of patriotic thinking and
action he invites into his world Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson,
and Alexander Hamilton. They remind him that he is a product of the
past and that it devolves upon him to pass on to posterity without
spot or blemish the heritage that has come to him through the
patriotic service and sacrifice of his progenitors.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Influence of people.</span>&mdash;That he
may never lose sight of the fact that it is cowardly and degrading
to recede from high ideals he opens the doors of his world for
Milton, Beethoven, and Michael Angelo. Their superb achievements,
considered in connection with their afflictions and hardships, are
a source of inspiration to him and keep him up to his best. As a
token of his appreciation of these exemplars he strives to excel
himself, thus proving himself a worthy disciple. They need not
chide him, for in their presence he cannot do otherwise than hold
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name=
"page314"></a>314</span>fast to his ideals and struggle upward with
a courage born of inspiration. Living among such goodly people, he
finds his world resplendent with the virtues that prove a halo to
life. With such people about him he can be neither lonely nor
despondent. If the cares of life fret him for the moment, he takes
counsel with them and his equilibrium is restored. In their company
he finds life a joyous experience, for their very presence exhales
the qualities that make life worth while.</p>
<p>As an inevitable result of all the influences that constitute
his world he finds himself yearning for meliorism as the
crownpiece. Drinking from the fount of inspiration that gushes
forth at the behest of all these wholesome influences, he longs for
betterment. Good as he finds the things about him, he feels that
they are not yet good enough. So he becomes the eloquent apostle of
meliorism, proclaiming his gospel without abatement. The roads are
not good enough, and he would have better ones. Our houses are not
good enough, and he would have people design and build better ones.
Our music is not good enough as yet, and he would encourage men and
women to write better. Our books are not good enough, and he would
incite people to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name=
"page315"></a>315</span>write better ones. Our conduct of civic
affairs is not good enough, and he would stimulate society to
strive for civic betterment. Our municipal government is not good
enough, and he proclaims the need to make improvement. Our national
government is not all that it might be, and he would have all
people join in a benevolent conspiracy to make it better.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Influence of the
school.</span>&mdash;Thus day by day this man continues the
building of a world for himself. And day by day he strives to make
his world better, not only as an abiding place for himself but also
as an example for others. In short, this man is a product of the
vitalized school, and is weaving into the pattern of his life the
teachings of the school. In exuberance of spirit and in fervent
gratitude he looks back to the school that taught him to know that
education is the process of world-building. And to the school he
gives the credit for the large and beautiful world in which he
lives.</p>

XXV</h2>
<h3>A TYPICAL VITALIZED SCHOOL</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The school an expression of the
teacher.</span>&mdash;The vitalized school may be a school of one
room or of forty rooms; it may be in the city, in the village, in
the hamlet, or in the heart of the country; it may be a
kindergarten, a grade school, a high school, or a college. The size
or the location of the school does not determine its vital quality.
This, on the contrary, is determined by the character of its work
and the spirit that obtains. In general it may be said that the
vitalized teacher renders the school vital. This places upon her a
large measure of responsibility, but she accepts it with
equanimity, and rejoices in the opportunity to test out her powers.
It needs to be oft repeated that if the teacher is static, the
school will be static; but if the teacher is dynamic, the school
will be dynamic. The teacher can neither delegate, abrogate, abate,
nor abridge her responsibility. The school is either vitalized or
it is not, according to what the teacher <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>318</span>is and does,
and what the teacher does depends upon what she is. In short, the
school is an expression of the teacher, and, if the school is not
vitalized, the reason is not far to seek.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">A centralized school.</span>&mdash;For
the purpose of illustration we may assume that the typical
vitalized school is located in the country, and is what is known as
a centralized school. The grounds comprise about ten acres, and the
building contains, all told, not fewer than twenty rooms, large and
small. This building was designed by a student of school problems,
and is not merely a theory of the architect. Each room, and each
detail, articulates with every other room in harmony with a general
scheme of which the child and his interests are the prime
considerations. The well-being of the child takes precedence over
the reputation of the architect. Every nook of the building has its
specific function, and this function has vital reference to the
child. The location of each piece of furniture can be explained
from the viewpoint of the child, and the architectural scheme is
considered subsidiary. The seats conform to the child, and not the
reverse. The scheme of lighting concerns itself with the
child&rsquo;s welfare rather than with the external appearance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name=
"page319"></a>319</span><span class="paraHead">Integrity in
construction and decoration.</span>&mdash;The decorations
throughout the building are all chaste and artistic. Nothing below
this standard can win admission. No picture is admitted that does
not represent art. The theory is that the school has a reflex
influence upon the homes that attracts them to its standards, and
experience reveals the fact that the decorations in the homes are
constantly rising in artistic tone. The standards of the school
become the standards of the pupils, and the pupils, in turn, modify
and improve the standards of the homes. There is a degree of
simplicity and dignity throughout the building that banishes from
the homes the ornate and the bizarre. There is integrity in every
detail of construction, and the absence of veneer gives to the
pupils a definition of honesty and sincerity. There is nothing
either in the building or in the work of the school that savors of
the show element. The teachers of history and mathematics cannot
display the products of their teaching and, therefore, there is no
display of her products by the teacher of drawing. This school
believes in education but not in exhibition. Words of commendation
may be dispensed in the classrooms, but there is no exhibit of any
department in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name=
"page320"></a>320</span>halls. The teachers are too polite and too
considerate to sanction any such display.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Simplicity and
sincerity.</span>&mdash;The library is notable for the character of
the books, but not for the number. The teachers and pupils are too
genuine ever to become thrasonical, and no teacher or pupil is ever
heard to boast of anything pertaining to the school. They neither
boast nor apologize, but leave every visitor free to make his own
appraisement of their school and its belongings. The teachers are
too truly cultured and the pupils are too well trained ever to
exploit themselves, their school, or their work. The pictures, the
statuary, the fittings, and the equipment are all of the best, and,
hence, show for themselves without exploitation. To teachers and
pupils it would seem a mark of ill-breeding to expatiate upon their
own things. Such a thing is simply not done in this school. The
auditorium is a stately, commodious, and beautiful room, and
everybody connected with the school accepts it as a matter of
course with no boastful comment. Anything approaching braggadocio
would prove a discordant note in this school, and, in this respect,
it represents the American ideal that is to be.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Rooms are phases of
life.</span>&mdash;The home economics <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page321" name="page321"></a>321</span>room, the industrial arts
room, the laboratories, the dining room, the rest rooms, and the
hospital room are all supplied with suitable fittings and equipment
and all represent phases of life. At luncheon each pupil is served
a bowl of soup or other hot dish to supplement his own private
lunch, and this food is supplied at public expense. The school
authorities have the wisdom to realize that health is an asset of
the community and is fundamental in effective school work. The
pupils serve their schoolmates in relays, wash the dishes, and
restore them to their places. The boys do not think they demean
themselves by such service, but enter into it in the true spirit of
democracy. A teacher is present to modify and chasten the hurry and
heedlessness of childhood, and there is decorum without apparent
repression.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Industrial work.</span>&mdash;In
connection with the industrial arts department there is a repair
shop where all the implements that are used in caring for the
school farm, gardens, orchards, and lawns are kept in repair. Here
the auto trucks in which the pupils are brought to the school are
repaired by the drivers, assisted by the boys. In this shop the
boys gain the practical knowledge that enables them to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name=
"page322"></a>322</span>in repair the tools and machinery,
including automobiles, at their homes. The farmers who have no sons
in school avail themselves of the skill and fidelity that obtain in
the shop, bringing in their tools, their harness, and their
automobiles for needed repairs. The money thus earned is expended
for school equipment. The products of the orchards, farm, and
garden are the property of the school and are all preserved for use
in the home economics department for school lunches. The man in
charge of the farm is employed by the year and is a member of the
teaching staff. The farm, gardens, orchard, and lawn are integral
parts of the school, and perform the functions of laboratories.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">School a life
enterprise.</span>&mdash;There are all grades in the school, from
the kindergarten through the high school. There is but slight
disparity in the size of the classes, for the parents instinctively
set apart thirteen years of the time of their children for life in
the school. To these parents school and life are synonymous, and
when a child enters the kindergarten he enlists in the enterprise
for a term of thirteen years. The homes as well as the school are
arranged on this basis, and this plan of procedure is ingrained in
the social consciousness. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323"
name="page323"></a>323</span>Deserting the school is no more
thought of than any other form of suicide. If, by any chance, a boy
should desert the school, he would be a pariah in that community
and could not live among the people in any degree of comfort. He
would be made to feel that he had debased himself and cast
aspersion upon society. The looks that the people would bestow upon
him would sting more than flagellation. He would be made to feel
that he had expatriated himself, and neither himself nor his
parents would be in good standing in the community. They would be
made to feel that their conduct was nothing short of sacrilege.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Public sentiment.</span>&mdash;In view of
the school sentiment that obtains in the community the eighth grade
is practically as populous as the first grade. Attendance upon
school work is a habit of thinking both with the children and with
their parents, and school is taken for granted the same as eating
and sleeping. If a boy should, for any cause, fail to graduate from
the high school, every patron of the school would regard it as a
personal calamity. They would feel that he had, somehow, been
dropped off the train before he reached his destination, and the
whole community would be inclined to wear <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>324</span>badges of
mourning. Every parent is vitally interested in each child of the
community, whether he has children in school or not, and thus
school taxes are paid with pride and elation. The school is
regarded as a safe investment that pays large dividends. Patrons
rally to the calls of the school with rare unanimity and
heartiness. Differences in politics and religion evaporate in their
school, for the school is the high plane upon which they meet in
fraternal concord.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The course of study.</span>&mdash;The
course of study is flexible, and because of its resiliency it
adapts itself easily and gracefully to the native dispositions and
the aptitudes of the various pupils. If the boy has a penchant for
agriculture, provision is made for him, both in the theory and in
the practical applications of the subject. If he inclines to
science, the laboratories accord him a gracious welcome. The
studies are adapted to the boy and not the boy to the studies. No
boy need discontinue school to find on the outside something that
is congenial, for, within the school, he may find work that
represents life in all its phases. If he yearns for horticulture,
then this study is made his major and, all in good time, he is made
foreman of the group <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name=
"page325"></a>325</span>who care for the gardens. If the course of
study lacks the element which he craves and for which he has a
natural aptitude, this branch is added to the course. The economy
of life demands the conservation of childhood and youth and the
school deems it the part of wisdom as well as civic and social
economy to provide special instruction for this boy, as was done in
the case of Helen Keller. This school, in theory and in practice,
is firm in its opposition to wasting boys and girls. Hence, ample
provision is made for the child of unusual inclinations.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Electives.</span>&mdash;The pupils do not
elect a study because it is easy, but because their inclinations
run in that direction. Indeed, there are no easy courses, no snap
courses in the school. Diligent, careful, thorough work is the
rule, and there can be found no semblance of approval for loafing
or dawdling. The school stands for purposes that are clear in
definition and for work that is intense. There are no prizes
offered for excellent work, but the approbation of parents,
teachers, and schoolmates, in the estimation of the pupils, far
transcends any material or symbolic prizes that could be offered.
In school work and in conduct the pupils all strive to win this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name=
"page326"></a>326</span>approval. There is no coarseness nor
boorishness, for that would forfeit this approval. The cigarette is
under ban, for public sentiment is against it; and, after all,
public sentiment is the final arbiter of conduct. Hence, no boy
will demean himself by flying in the face of public sentiment
through indulging in any practice that this sentiment proclaims
unclean or enervating.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The school the focus of community
life.</span>&mdash;This school is the focus of the community.
Hither come the patrons for music, for lectures, for art, for books
and magazines, for social stimulus, and, in short, for all the
elements of their avocational life. Indeed, in educational matters,
the community is a big wholesome family and the school is the
shrine about which they assemble for educational and cultural
communion. It is quite a common practice for mothers to sit in the
classrooms engaged in knitting or sewing while their children are
busy with their lessons. For, in their conception of life,
geography and sewing are co&ouml;rdinate elements, and so blend in
perfect harmony in the school r&eacute;gime. At the luncheon period
these mothers go to the dining room with their children in the same
spirit of co&ouml;peration that gives distinction to the school and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name=
"page327"></a>327</span>to the community. There is an interflow of
interests between the school and the homes that makes for unity of
purpose and practice. There is freedom in the school but not
license. People move about in a natural way but with delicate
consideration for the rights and sentiments of others. The
atmosphere of the school interdicts rudeness. There is a quiet
dignity, serenity, and intensity, with no abatement of freedom. In
this school it is not good form for a boy to be less than a
gentleman or for a girl to be less than a lady.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The teachers.</span>&mdash;The atmosphere
in which the pupils live is, mainly, an exhalation from the spirit
of the teachers. They live and work together in a delightful spirit
of concord and co&ouml;peration. They are magnanimous and would
refuse to be a part of any life that would decline from this high
plane. In this corps there are no hysterics, no heroics, no strain,
no stress. They are, first of all, successful human beings; and
their expert teaching is an expression of their human qualities.
Their teaching is borne along on the tones of conversation. They
know that well-modulated tones of voice contribute to the culture
and well-being of the school. Should a teacher ever indulge in
screeching, nagging, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name=
"page328"></a>328</span>hectoring, badgering, or sarcasm, she would
find herself ostracized. Such things are simply not done in this
school. Hence, she would soon realize that this school is no place
for her and would voluntarily resign. The school is simply above
and beyond her kind.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">Unity of purpose.</span>&mdash;Among the
teachers there are no jealousies, because each one is striving to
exalt the others. They are so generous in their impulses, and have
such exalted conceptions of life, that they incline to catalogue
their colleagues among the very elect. The teacher in the high
school and the teacher in the primary grade hold frequent
conversations concerning each other&rsquo;s work, and no teacher
ever loses interest in the pupils when they advance to the next
grade. To such teachers, education is not parceled out in terms of
years but is a continuous process, even as life itself. They use
the text-book merely as a convenience, but never as a necessity. If
all the text-books in the school should be destroyed overnight, the
work would proceed as usual the next day, barring mere
inconvenience. They respect themselves and others too highly ever
to assume a patronizing air toward their pupils. On the contrary,
they treat them as co&ouml;rdinates <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page329" name="page329"></a>329</span>and confederates in the
noble and exhilarating game of life.</p>
<p><span class="paraHead">The vitalized school.</span>&mdash;They
have due regard to their personal appearance, but, once they have
decided for the day, they dismiss the matter from their thinking
and devote their attention to major considerations. Neither in
dress, in manner, nor in conversation do they ever bring into the
school a discordant note. School hours are not a detached portion
of life but, rather, an integral part of life, and to them life is
quite as agreeable during these hours as before and after. Such as
they cannot do otherwise than render the school vital. And when
such teachers and patrons as these join in such a benevolent
conspiracy, then shall we realize not only a typical school but the
vitalized school.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
